Throughout 2020/21, we’ve ensured that our governance arrangements are \\nappropriate to the range of challenges we’ve faced. We’ve acted on external feedback and \\ncorporate governance reviews to maintain a high standard of governance.\\n\\nCovid-19 governance\\n\\nDevolution\\n\\nIn response to the pandemic we activated our Strategic \\nCrisis Management Team (SCMT). Led by the director \\nof Network Services, the SCMT includes colleagues from \\nacross the organisation and is responsible for managing the \\nimpact of coronavirus on the railway, our passengers and \\nour people. The SCMT initially met daily, and then weekly, \\nto coordinate the continuity of the company’s business and \\nkeep the railway open. \\n\\nThe SCMT has been supported by the National Alert \\nCoordination Group, which manages the logistical response \\nto the pandemic within Network Rail. This included \\nensuring our workforce had the right personal protective \\nequipment to continue working safely and coordinating our \\ntesting programme to provide an extra layer of protection \\nfor our people. Command structures within our regions and \\ndirectorates also implemented necessary policy changes \\nand managed day-to-day issues. \\n\\nWith the Rail Delivery Group, we created the Joint Executive \\nOversight Team where we worked to coordinate an industry-\\nwide response. And the Rail Industry Coronavirus Forum set \\nup Emergency Working Principles Agreements that enabled \\nNetwork Rail and the trades unions to prioritise activities \\nand work more quickly.\\n\\nOur Board, its committees and the executive leadership \\nteam have continued to meet online to ensure we meet the \\nneeds of the railway. See page 15 for more on our response \\nto the pandemic.\\n\\nIn 2019 we started our Putting Passengers First journey with a \\nreorganisation. We devolved accountabilities and established \\nplatforms for us to deliver value for money to those we serve. \\nWe’ve made good progress, with new ways of working already \\nreaping rewards for our customers and passengers.\\n\\nBecause of the added challenges caused by the pandemic, \\nwe’ve re organised ourselves to strengthen devolution \\nand be more agile and efficient. To give us fewer network-\\nwide functions at executive level, we’ve transferred the \\nresponsibilities of both Network Services and the Group \\nTransformation team into other existing network-wide \\nfunctions.\\n\\nNetwork Services provided services to our routes and regions, \\nas well as network-wide operational oversight. We’ve put \\nNetwork Services’ route/region services together with Route \\nServices so there’s one place for interaction with internal \\ncustomers, routes and regions. And to support better \\noversight and decision making across the full performance \\ncycle of the railway, we’ve moved Network Services’ activities \\nthat help the rail network operate effectively as a system \\ninto System Operator. We believe this will provide the best \\noperational service for our customers and passengers.\\n\\nThere were previously teams leading on transformation at \\na network-wide level in Group Transformation and within \\nNetwork Services. We’ve now transferred these teams to \\nGroup HR.\\n\\nFor more information on our Putting Passengers First \\nprogrammee se page 20.\\n\\n94   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\n\\x0cRail Reform\\n\\nOn 20 May 2021 the Government published “Great British \\nRailways: Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail – White Paper”. \\nIt shows how the Government “will make railways the \\nbackbone of a cleaner, more environmentally friendly and \\nmodern public transport system across the country.\\n\\n“By replacing franchising, accelerating innovation and \\nintegrating the railways, Great British Railway will deliver an \\nefficient, financially sustainable railway that meets the needs \\nof passengers and those who rely on rail on a daily basis.”\\n\\nThe Board fully supports the Williams-Shapps Plan for \\nRail and will work closely with industry partners and key \\nstakeholders to deliver its objectives.\\n\\nEngaging with our stakeholders\\n\\nAt Network Rail we consider our stakeholders to be at the \\nheart of our strategy. The interests of key stakeholders \\nand the matters set out in section 172 of the Companies \\nAct 2006 (i.e. promoting success of the company) \\n(see pages 24 to 25) have been considered in Board \\ndiscussions and decision making. \\n\\nThe Putting Passengers First programme was built on an \\nextensive listening exercise. We listened to a wide variety \\nof stakeholders to help us understand what the company \\ndoes well and where it needs to improve. We engaged with \\nmore than 300 colleagues at all levels, across the country, \\nincluding frontline and office based, as well as external \\npartners and organisations. The outcomes informed our \\nPutting Passengers First programme.\\n\\nRailway supervisory boards comprising Network Rail, train \\noperating companies, Transport Focus, and other key \\nstakeholders provide forums for discussions to identify \\nopportunities to improve the experience of all passengers \\nand freight users. The aim of these boards is to bring \\ntrack and train closer together. Meetings were held in the \\nWestern route, Wales route, Anglia route, West Coast Main \\nLine, and Chilterns; the System Operator Advisory Board \\nprovides a similar function.\\n\\nEngaging with our workforce\\n\\nWe recognise that employees who feel actively engaged with \\nthe company, its purpose, vision and strategy and who feel \\n\\nCorporate governance\\n\\nlistened to, are more likely to feel that their work is meaningful \\nand will make a difference for users of the railway.\\n\\nSince its development, the Network Rail Story (see page \\n8) has been the foundation of our workforce engagement. \\nWe’ve a wide range of initiatives through which we engage \\nwith our people, including:\\n•  Putting Passengers First programme;\\n•  systems thinking interventions;\\n•  listening programmes;\\n•  business briefings;\\n•  employee networks;\\n•  reverse mentoring\\n•  Trade Union engagement; and\\n•  employee newsletters (The Network and Front Line Focus).\\n\\nAs well as this, we use regular employee engagement \\nsurveys to understand what our people are thinking and \\nfeeling at a given time. The surveys show whether there has \\nbeen an improvement compared with previous years, and if \\nfurther action is needed.

Further details \\nabout Network Rail’s organisational diversity and inclusion \\npolicies and how these have been implemented in the year \\ncan be found in the Our people section, page 67.\\n\\nWe know that to truly put passengers first, empower our \\npeople and make them proud to work here, our senior \\nleadership needs to be reflective of our passengers, our \\npeople and the communities we serve. That’s why the Board \\napproved Network Rail’s first Board diversity and inclusion \\npolicy in February 2021. The policy notes the company’s \\nlong-term ambitions in relation to board diversity and \\nspecific objectives to progress towards them. These include \\nthat, by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, at least one \\nthird of the Board will be female and one of the directors \\nwill be from a BAME background.\\n\\nThe policy is supplementary to the organisational equality, \\ndiversity and inclusion policy and the Everyone Matters \\ndiversity strategy, and implements their aspirations in the \\ncontext of our senior leaders. The full policy can be found \\non the Network Rail website www.networkrail.co.uk. \\n\\nThe Board is comprised of ten non-executive directors and \\ntwo executive directors.

In line with best practice, \\nManchester Square Partners (MSP) undertook a review of the \\neffectiveness of the Network Rail Board in early 2021.\\n\\nThe process involved one-to-one interviews with Board \\nmembers and the group general counsel and company \\nsecretary. Executive leadership team members,  \\ncolleagues at the DfT, ORR and Transport Scotland were \\nalso interviewed.\\n\\nand more strategic matters was appropriate. It was \\nacknowledged that some of the technical, operational \\nmatters had a strategic element to them; \\n\\n2. given the Board’s complex and busy agenda, careful \\n\\nattention should be paid to the resilience and capacity \\nof individuals to effectively manage a substantial volume \\nof work. In this context it was important that succession \\nplans for senior and business critical roles were regularly \\nreviewed for both planned and unplanned situations; and\\n\\n3. the importance of giving the Board sufficient time for \\nreflection and discussion that was not driven by an \\nagenda or the need to make decisions. \\n\\nMSP reviewed Board and committee meeting papers and \\nobserved the March 2021 Board meeting. A report on the \\nreview, including recommendations, was provided to the \\nBoard in July 2021.\\n\\nAn action plan was being developed to address these \\nfindings. The action plan, and progress against delivering \\nit, would be agreed/monitored by the nomination and \\nremuneration committee.\\n\\nThe key findings of MSP’s board effectiveness review are set \\nout below.\\n\\nThe key finding from the review was that the Board was “an \\nexceptionally busy and demanding one with a challenging \\nand content rich agenda … overall performance is \\ndeemed strong”. Manchester Square Partners’ primary \\nrecommendations to make the Board even more effective \\nincluded:\\n1. the Board should consider whether the balance between \\n\\ntechnical, operational matters coming to the Board \\n\\nProfessional development, training \\nand support for directors\\n\\nBoard members are offered a range of training and \\ndevelopment opportunities each year to support their \\ncontinuing professional development.

The directors have \\nthe right to seek independent professional advice at reasonable expense to Network Rail.\\n\\nIn November 2020 the Board was briefed on the periodic review (PR) process, ahead of PR23. Periodic reviews are one \\nof the principal mechanisms by which the ORR holds Network Rail to account and secures value for money for users and \\nfunders of the railway. PR23 will determine what Network Rail should deliver in our role of operating, maintaining and \\nrenewing the network in Control Period 7, which will run from April 2024 – March 2029. The briefing considered Network \\nRail’s regulatory environment and the Board’s role in the PR process.\\n\\nElection and re-election of directors\\n\\nEach of the directors is subject to (re-) election at the 2021 \\nAGM. The Board considers that all directors act in good \\nfaith, for the long-term benefit and success of Network Rail, \\nand continue to perform effectively.\\n\\nDirectors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability \\ninsurance\\n\\nNetwork Rail maintains D&O liability insurance. Network \\nRail did not indemnify any directors during 2020/21.\\n\\nDirectors’ conflict of interest\\n\\nThe Annual General Meeting (AGM)\\n\\nThe Board identifies and manages potential conflicts of \\ninterests that directors may have.

Running a safe railway will always be \\nour priority. We want everyone to feel safe whether they’re \\nworking on, living near, or travelling on the railway. We’ve \\nworked tirelessly to keep our passengers and workforce safe \\nduring the Covid-19 pandemic, while operating a railway to \\nhelp key workers, transport much needed freight goods, and \\nkeep the rest of the country running.\\n\\nThe pandemic had a major impact on our safety \\nperformance this year. And we have been strengthening \\nhow we support mental health and wellbeing. At the end of \\n2020/21, 20 per cent of line managers had been trained. \\nThis is a 10 per cent increase on 2019/20. Because we’ve \\nbeen socially distancing colleagues we’ve had more vehicles \\non the road; life-saving rules breaches rose and were mostly \\nrelated to employees speeding in road vehicles. \\n\\nTragically, three people lost their lives on the 12 August \\n2020 when a train derailed at Carmont, near Stonehaven. \\nBrett McCullough was driving the train, Donald Dinnie was \\na conductor, and Christopher Stuchbury was a passenger. \\nIn response, Network Rail set up two new external task \\nforces, one aimed at its response to severe weather events, \\nand the other aimed at management of earthworks and \\ndrainage along the railway.\\n\\nThe number of suicides and trespass incidents that took \\nplace on the railway was slightly below that of the previous \\nyear. Our partnership with Learn Live has educated over ten \\nmillion children and young people in schools and colleges \\nnationally, on the dangers associated with railway trespass; \\nthis has coincided with an encouraging reduction in reported \\nchild trespass. The remit for this relationship has now been \\nextended to include level crossing and station safety.\\n\\nSadly, there were also three workforce fatalities in the year. \\nOn 8 April 2020 Aden Ashurst, working for AmcoGiffen, \\nwas struck by a train at Roade. On 30 November 2020, \\nKevin Mauger was fatality injured at the Long-Welded Rail \\nFacility in Eastleigh. On 9 February 2021, Tyler Byrne was \\nstruck by a train at Surbiton. Investigations are underway \\nto determine the causes and to prevent similar events from \\never happening again. \\n\\nThe trackworker Safety Task Force has continued its \\nwork to improve our people’s safety when working on \\nour tracks through better task planning, increased use of \\nsafety equipment, and through the eradication of lookout \\nworking. The task force has completed 2,913 out of 6,463 \\nkey objectives that are to be delivered by 31 July 2022; \\nand we’ve seen the use of unassisted lookouts decrease by \\nover 75 per cent since July 2019. Near misses involving our \\nworkforce have also decreased by half during 2020/21.\\n\\n104   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\nThe committee reviewed the safety performance data \\nthat makes up part of the performance related pay award \\nfor senior executives and made a recommendation to the \\nremuneration committee (see page 126).\\n\\nMike Putnam,\\nchair, safety, health and environmental \\ncompliance committee\\n15 July 2021\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nCommittee members\\n\\nFormal appointment to \\nthe committee \\n\\nNumber of meetings attended  \\nduring the year\\n\\nMike Putnam\\n\\nRob Brighouse\\n\\nSir Peter Hendy\\n\\nDavid Noyes\\n\\nFeb 2018\\n\\nJan 2016\\n\\nOct 2015\\n\\nDec 2018\\n\\n*  Stephen Duckworth was appointed to the Board and committee on 1 April 2021\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n6/6\\n\\nCommittee attendees\\n\\nSeveral of our executives are invited to attend the \\ncommittee’s meetings including the chief executive, the \\ngroup director for the Technical Authority, and the chief \\nquality, health, safety and environment officer.

This adds scrutiny and challenge \\nto the committee’s business and is consistent with our \\ncommitment to remain transparent to the wider rail \\nindustry and its important stakeholders. \\n\\nIan Prosser CBE, chief inspector of railways and director of \\nrailway safety at the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), attends \\ntwo meetings each year to present the regulator’s view on \\nour safety performance. \\n\\nRole and responsibilities of the \\ncommittee\\n\\nThe environmental aspect of the committee’s role has \\nbeen redefined since the creation of the environmental \\nsustainability committee in 2020. The SHEC committee \\nnow oversees environmental legal and regulatory \\ncompliance while the environmental sustainability \\ncommittee has broader responsibility for environmental \\nstrategy and related matters. \\n\\nThe committee’s role is to monitor how the company \\nimplements its responsibilities on safety and health through \\nits everyday business activities, and how it complies with \\nits environmental obligations. The committee needs to be \\n\\nsatisfied that the company’s relevant strategies, policies \\nand procedures are effective, reviewed and adapted as \\nnecessary to evolving business activities.\\n\\nWhat the committee does: \\n•  it reviews the group’s strategies, systems, policies \\n\\nand practices for SHEC. It also makes sure that the \\ngovernance and management structures support these \\nbeing implemented effectively \\n\\n•  it considers the significant risks to individuals and the \\n\\ncompany’s strategies for SHEC and whether the executive \\nis managing them effectively \\n\\n•  it reviews internal audits, within its SHEC remit, that are \\ncarried out across the company on the effectiveness of \\nstrategies, systems, policies and practices. It makes sure \\nthat the audits have the correct scope and it follows up to \\nconfirm that any recommendations have been properly \\naddressed and implemented\\n\\n•  it considers findings from internal and external \\n\\ninvestigations and how the executive has responded to \\nthem\\n\\n•  it makes recommendations to the nomination and \\nremuneration committee on the company’s SHEC \\nperformance to inform decisions about performance \\nrelated pay. \\n\\nAfter each meeting, the chair reports to the next Network \\nRail Board meeting.\\n\\nPrincipal activities during the year\\n\\nIn 2020/21 the committee discussed:\\n•  quarterly SHEC reports from the group Technical \\n\\nAuthority. These included scorecard data, information \\non workforce safety, workforce and contractor accidents, \\ntrain accident risks, level crossings, health and wellbeing, \\npublic safety, and contractor performance\\n\\n•  quarterly updates on safety risks and internal audits on \\n\\nSHEC matters \\n\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   105\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\n•  scrutiny of SHEC-related incidents including those at Carmont, Eastleigh, Surbiton, Margam, and Llangennech and what \\nlessons could be learned and applied, and monitoring our business follow up to any SHEC related recommendations from \\nthe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) \\n\\n•  the SHEC performance of our regions and functions, particularly focussing on how safety and health and wellbeing were \\n\\nbeing incorporated and devolved within Network Rail’s Putting Passengers First programme\\n\\n•  quarterly updates on SHEC matters relating to the Covid-19 pandemic including keeping our workforce and the public \\n\\nsafe and well \\n\\n•  safety, health and wellbeing strategies including the safety of the public on and around the railway network including on \\ntrains, at level crossings and in stations; track worker safety and the actions we’re taking to reduce the number of near \\nmisses on and near railway tracks\\n\\n•  Lord Robert Mair’s review of earthworks following the tragic accident at Carmont, Aberdeenshire on 12 August 2020\\n•  Our business-wide programmes to improve safety culture in the workplace including the Safety Task Force which was set \\nup following the tragic events at Margam in July 2019, and the safety culture programme conducted by JMJ consultants.\\n\\nInternal audit\\nInternal audit plays a key role in providing independent assurance in managing safety, health and environmental \\ncompliance risks. At each meeting the director of risk and internal audit updated the committee on any changes to the \\nSHEC audit plan, notable audits, overdue actions, themes and key issues arising from Internal Audit’s work.\\n\\nAudits included our management of manual handling and spoken safety critical communications, and activities are now \\nunderway to address the risks. This includes updating both organisation wide standards and policies as well as route \\noperational controls. Internal Audit has reviewed the progress of the safety task force, providing confidence that it is \\nappropriately set-up to deliver, and will continue to provide independent assurance during 2021.\\n\\nAnnual site visit, July 2020\\nThe committee makes an annual visit to locations around the country to see first-hand the SHEC issues they discuss at \\nmeetings. In 2020 the committee visited Reading Station to review the recent developments at the station itself, Reading \\nDepot, and the new technology and equipment that the Safety Task Force was trialling to keep track workers safe from the \\nrisk of moving trains.\\n\\nPlanned activities for 2021/22 \\n\\n•  Workforce safety and wellbeing including ongoing monitoring of progress made by the Safety Task Force and safety \\n\\nculture programmes. \\n\\n•  Public and workforce safety including an ongoing review of fire inspection compliance and procedures across the business.\\n•  A review of signals passed at danger incidents (SPADs) and reviewing potential technical solutions.\\n•  Environmental compliance and ongoing monitoring of how Network Rail is ensuring compliance with environmental \\n\\nlegislation, regulation and best practice. \\n\\n•  Governance: monitoring SHEC issues and how they are being effectively addressed within Network Rail’s evolving business \\n\\nstructure. \\n\\n106   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL \\nSUSTAINABILITY \\nCOMMITTEE REPORT\\n\\nI’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the \\nkey activities undertaken during 2020/21 alongside its \\nanticipated activities for 2021/22.\\n\\nAn environmental sustainability advisory committee \\nhad been originally created in October 2019 to provide \\nsupport and advice to the executive in the development \\nof Network Rail’s environmental sustainability strategy \\nwhich was approved by the Board in July 2020.

Mark has spent much of his career in the rail \\nsector. He has particular experience in major projects, \\nrestructurings and corporate finance. \\n\\nThe past year has been incredibly challenging for our \\nretailers, tenants and commercial partners. We have \\nbeen determined to show them support, care and \\nempathy during the pandemic, while they’ve continued \\nwhen possible to provide vital goods and services for \\nour passengers, particularly those critical workers who \\nhave kept the country moving during the pandemic. In \\nMarch 2020, we introduced swift and significant financial \\nmeasures to support retailers in our managed stations \\nand tenants in our commercial estate. These measures \\nhave continued throughout 2020/21 and the committee \\nhas helped to shape and refine them. We’ve also engaged \\nwith the wider rail sector and Government to ensure our \\nfinancial measures are commensurate and fair. And we’ve \\nchampioned collective approaches and shared lessons \\nlearned during an unprecedented crisis for the sector. \\n\\nWe’ve focussed on devolving Property from a national \\nfunction to a regional model, as part of our wider programme \\nto put passengers first. This key milestone was achieved in \\nSeptember, with five regional property teams established, \\neach led by a regional property director. They are now \\nsupported by a smaller group property team, led by our \\ngroup property director. Group Property provides services and \\nactivities to the regions, as well as delivering some activities \\ncentrally for reasons of value add, economic and consistency. \\n\\nEmbedding property expertise within each region will \\nbetter align the teams to regional objectives and develop \\nstrategies that put passengers first. They’ll do this by \\n\\noptimising the use of operational land, generating capital \\nreceipts to reinvest in the railway, releasing land for new \\nhomes, and improving conditions and access for our \\nfrontline staff.\\n\\nThe committee has continued to monitor Network Rail’s \\noverall property performance against its strategy for Control \\nPeriod 6 (CP6). This has ensured property colleagues across \\nthe company continued to focus on supporting the regions \\nto deliver activities, put passengers first, develop sites \\nthrough partnerships, and deliver land for housing. They’ve \\nalso been working with partners to deliver positive railway \\nand community outcomes, and providing great places for \\nbusinesses and communities to thrive.\\n\\nSir Peter Hendy CBE,\\nchair, property supervisory committee\\n15 July 2021\\n\\nCommittee \\nmembers\\n\\nFormal \\nappointment to \\nthe committee \\n(formerly \\nProperty \\nSupervisory \\nBoard)\\n\\nNumber of \\nmeetings \\nattended  \\nduring the year\\n\\nSir Peter Hendy \\nCBE\\n\\nDecember 2019\\n\\n6/6\\n\\nMark Bayley CBE1 October 2020\\n\\nNeil Sachdev MBE July 2016\\n\\nStephen Smith\\n\\nJuly 2016\\n\\n3/6\\n\\n5/6\\n\\n6/6\\n\\n1.

The committee also oversees risk \\nmanagement, regulatory reporting and compliance. It \\nmakes recommendations to the Board on the level of risk \\nappetite acceptable to the company.\\n\\nFollowing each meeting, the chair provides a summary \\nof the committee’s activities, main discussion points and \\nfindings to the next Board meeting along with a written \\nreport provided by the committee secretary, and makes \\nrecommendations as appropriate.\\n\\nPrincipal activities during the year\\n\\nThe committee had presentations from four regional \\nmanaging directors on the key risks affecting their business \\nplans. There were also updates on the Putting Passengers \\nFirst programme, cyber security, the competence \\nmanagement system, business contingency planning in \\n\\nresponse to the Covid-19 pandemic, timetabling risks, and \\nweather and climate change resilience.\\n\\nAt each meeting the committee receives business updates \\nfrom group finance, internal audit, group risk and the \\nindependent external auditor. In addition to regular updates, \\nthe committee considers the emerging and principal risks \\nfacing the business and elevates these to the Board where \\nnecessary. The committee conducts an annual evaluation of \\nits effectiveness, details of which are provided below.\\n\\nFair, balanced and understandable\\n\\nFollowing a review, the audit and risk committee confirmed \\nthat the annual report and financial statements for \\n2020/21 present a fair, balanced and understandable \\noverview and provides the information necessary to assess \\nthe company’s position, performance, business model and \\nstrategy. The committee therefore proposed the document \\nfor approval to the Board.\\n\\nSignificant accounting judgements, key assumptions and estimates\\n\\nWith the support of the NAO, the committee assessed whether suitable accounting policies had been adopted, whether \\nmanagement had made appropriate estimates and judgements, and disclosures were balanced and fair. The main areas of \\nfocus during the year are set out below.\\n\\nAccounting judgments\\n\\nHow the committee addressed those judgements\\n\\nValuation of rail network \\nand compliance with \\nregulatory requirements\\n\\nThe revaluation model used to measure the value of the rail network consists of a number of \\nestimates and judgements made both by the company and by the Office of Rail and Road \\n(for example anticipated financial and operational outperformance in the Control Period \\n(CP6). The committee reviewed reports from management on the key estimates and the \\nmethodology applied to the revaluation model.\\n\\nThe committee also reviewed the work of management and findings of the external \\nauditors in respect of the reasonableness of key judgements and estimates in respect of the \\nforecast for CP6, and the impact of the recent White Paper; and the appropriateness of the \\nassociated disclosures in the financial statements.\\n\\nAfter this review, the committee confirmed the valuation derived from the estimates, key \\njudgments and valuation methodology.\\n\\n112   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nCapital accruals\\n\\nThe estimate of cost of work done is a key judgement in Network Rail’s accounts.\\n\\nRisk of management \\noverride of internal \\ncontrols\\n\\nDeferred tax\\n\\nIt was considered \\nwhether it was still \\nappropriate for Network \\nRail not to recognise \\na deferred tax asset in \\nrelation to its brought \\nforward tax losses.\\n\\nValuation of investment \\nproperties\\n\\nPension assumptions\\n\\nThe additions to property, plant and equipment are valued at an estimate of the cost of \\nwork done (COWD) in the year to 31 March 2021. To the extent that the COWD is greater \\nthan the invoiced amount, fixed asset accruals are recognised based on expected amounts \\nrequired to settle contractual obligations.\\n\\nTo value the COWD on capital projects appropriately, commercial managers with the \\nappropriate level of experience assess the progress to completion of the project at the ex-\\npected cost. Both progress and expected costs have elements that are estimates and require \\naccounting judgement.\\n\\nReports on management’s approach to measuring cost of work done were reviewed along-\\nside details of internal validation and the external auditor’s report on sample testing. \\n\\nThe independent auditor has focussed attention on this area and provided satisfactory \\nreporting to the committe.\\n\\nThe committee agreed not to recognise a deferred tax asset until it was satisfied when it \\ncould be exchanged for economic benefits. With the high levels of investment expected for \\nthe foreseeable future, the committee saw little prospect that taxable profits would exceed \\ncapital allowances, therefore requiring use of tax assets (including losses brought forward) to \\nreduce tax liabilities.\\n\\nInvestment properties are stated at fair value. The valuations are based on assumptions and \\nestimates that require judgement. The committee agreed the appropriate methodology had \\nbeen used. The methodology was consistent with prior years and included valuations and \\nadditional assistance from external valuation specialists. The valuations were reviewed by \\nmanagement and the external valuation specialists.\\n\\nThe group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. Valuation \\nof the defined benefit schemes is dependent on certain key assumptions and complex ac-\\ntuarial calculations. External actuaries are therefore engaged to assist in advising on key \\nassumptions and determining the value of the pension obligations.\\n\\nThe committee noted the conclusion of the triennial valuation in the year. The committee \\ndiscussed the key assumptions, including the degree to which these were supported by pro-\\nfessional advice from the actuaries. The independent auditor also focussed attention on this \\narea and provided reporting to the committee on this matter.\\n\\nFinally, the committee considered the valuation of the scheme assets, noting the estimation \\nuncertainty associated with Level 3 assets such as private equity holdings. This included a \\nconsideration of the work of management and the auditor to take account of movements to \\nthe year end, and the focussed work of the auditor in respect of higher risk assets.\\n\\nThe committee is required to review any correspondence received from regulators in respect of financial reporting. There \\nhas been no correspondence from the FRC or the ORR in relation to Network Rail’s financial reporting during the 2020/21 \\nfinancial year.\\n\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   113\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nCommittee Effectiveness\\n\\nThe committee completed a self-evaluation effectiveness \\nreview, supported by more detailed interviews with \\ncommittee members and key attendees. The review has \\nshown that the committee was functioning effectively, \\nand no significant areas of concern were raised. The \\nrecommendations are being taken forward to improve the \\nwork of the committee.\\n\\nIn addition, as part of the Board effectiveness evaluation \\nundertaken in early 2021, feedback was provided on the \\neffectiveness of the committee. No areas of concern related \\nto the committee were raised during this review.\\n\\nThe approach taken to the \\nappointment of the external auditor\\n\\nThe Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), supported \\nby the NAO, was appointed as Network Rail’s independent \\nauditor in 2015. In addition to providing an opinion on \\nthe group accounts, the C&AG also audits the individual \\naccounts of Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC, \\nNetwork Rail Infrastructure Limited and Network Rail (High \\nSpeed) Limited.\\n\\nGareth Davies assumed the post of C&AG on 1 June 2019.\\n\\nPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) acted as the independent \\nauditors for the remaining subsidiaries in 2020/21. \\nThe obligation to appoint the C&AG as Network \\nRail’s independent auditor is a direct impact of the \\nreclassification of Network Rail as an arm’s-length \\ngovernment body and is in line with standard arrangements \\nfor other public sector bodies.\\n\\nThe company is, therefore, not in a position to comply with \\nthe Competition and Markets Authority’s Order or the UK \\nCorporate Governance Code 2018 in respect of tendering \\nprior to the appointment of an auditor and this will remain \\nthe company’s position for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nObjectivity and independence of the \\nindependent auditor\\n\\nThe NAO is independent of Network Rail in accordance with \\nthe ethical requirements relevant to the audit of financial \\n\\n114   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\nstatements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard \\nas applied to listed entities/public interest entities.\\n\\nThe committee has put in place safeguards to maintain \\nthe independent auditor’s objectivity and independence. \\nTo enhance independence and in line with established \\nauditing standards, a new senior statutory auditor of the \\nindependent auditor is normally appointed every five years, \\nwith other key audit principals within that firm rotated \\nevery seven years.\\n\\nThe committee has established a policy whereby \\nemployment of the independent auditor on other work for \\nthe company is prohibited without prior approval by the \\ncommittee, other than for audit services or tax compliance \\nservices. Such requests are unlikely as the NAO does not \\noffer non-audit services. The NAO does carry out value for \\nmoney assessments for Network Rail, but this does not \\nrepresent a service to Network Rail as it is performed under \\nstatute and on behalf of Parliament.\\n\\nIn 2020/21 the fee for audit services was £0.597m \\n(£0.57m in 2019/20). This includes the NAO’s cost of \\nauditing Network Rail Infrastructure Limited, Network Rail \\nInfrastructure Finance plc, Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd, \\nthe regulatory accounts and review of interim financial \\nstatements of Network Rail Limited and Network Rail \\nInfrastructure Finance plc. It excludes the cost of the audit \\nof some smaller subsidiaries which continue to be audited \\nby PwC.\\n\\nThe fee paid to PwC for auditing the smaller subsidiaries \\nwas circa £155k in 2020/21 (£150k in 2019/20).\\n\\nEffectiveness of the external auditor\\n\\nA review of the independent auditor’s performance \\nand effectiveness is undertaken as part of the overall \\neffectiveness review of the auditing process. Following \\nthe conclusion of the 2020/21 reporting cycle, the \\nauditing process was assessed. The independent auditor \\nwas also invited to comment on what worked well and \\nwhere improvements could be made. The committee was \\nsatisfied that the independent auditor was fully effective \\nand performed as expected in discharging its duties and \\nobligations. For the second year, the external audit has \\nbeen completed in a remote way due to Covid-19 and \\nyet has remained effective with good communication \\nbetween teams. \\n\\n\\x0cInternal audit\\n\\nThe committee approved the annual internal audit plan \\nand reviewed throughout the year to check alignment \\nwith the group’s strategic priorities and key risks. At each \\nmeeting the director of risk and internal audit updated \\nthe committee on any changes to the plan, notable \\naudits, overdue actions, themes, and key issues arising \\nfrom internal audit’s work. Despite restrictions presented \\nby the pandemic, internal audit activities continued \\nthroughout the year and the audit programme was \\nupdated based on the assessment of risk in what was a \\nchanging environment.\\n\\nIn addition to formal risk-based audit, independent reviews \\nhave been undertaken to support key programmes and \\nthe response to emerging issues. These reviews have \\nincluded the response to the pandemic, preparations for the \\nUK’s exit from the EU, and the progress of our intelligent \\ninfrastructure programme.\\n\\nDuring the year, a root cause framework has been \\nintroduced to identify common themes arising from audit \\nactivity. These include:\\n\\nGovernance: audits identified cases of less mature \\ngovernance, risk and control (GRC) frameworks both  \\nin design and operating effectiveness – for example,  \\nin our audits of post-contract management and  \\nstations management.\\n\\nProcesses and procedures: audits flagged evidence of \\ngaps that meant the operation of controls could not be \\ndemonstrated – for example, in our audits of our joiners-\\nmovers-leavers process where system access was not \\nperiodically reviewed, and leavers were not removed in a \\ntimely manner.\\n\\nAssurance and monitoring: audits found weaknesses in \\nassurance and monitoring arrangements – for example, \\ncontract and procurement controls, tunnel evaluations, and \\nmonitoring overcrowding incidents at stations.\\n\\nWhere areas for improvement have been identified through \\naudit activity, these are being actively managed and \\nthe improvements closely monitored by the committee. \\nExamples of improvements include: the governance, risk, \\nassurance and improvement (GRAI) model that is being \\nembedded to strengthen line of sight between the business \\nstrategy and how this is to be achieved, and the revised \\nprocurement management framework rolled out in 2020.\\n\\nCorporate governance\\n\\nThe committee approved the internal audit charter which \\ndefines internal audit’s purpose, authority, responsibility \\nand position within the company.\\n\\nRisk management and  \\ninternal controls\\n\\nThe Board has ultimate responsibility for Network Rail’s risk \\nmanagement and internal control systems, but delegates \\ndetailed oversight of the function to the committee, which \\nthen reports its findings and makes recommendations to the \\nBoard. This covers all material controls including financial, \\noperational and compliance controls and risk management \\nsystems. The risk management systems and internal controls \\nare designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and \\ncan only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance \\nthat the group’s risks are being appropriately managed \\nand mitigated. The delegated responsibilities for risk \\nmanagement and internal control are detailed in ‘Role and \\nresponsibilities of the committee’ on page 112.\\n\\nThe committee reviews progress against agreed action \\nplans to manage identified risks. Detailed oversight of \\nsafety related risks is delegated from the Board to the \\nsafety, health and environment compliance committee.\\n\\nNetwork Rail’s approach to risk management and \\nidentification, its risk appetite, and an assessment of \\nprincipal and emerging risks is provided on pages 77 to 86.\\n\\nIn addition to regular updates, the committee reviews \\nthe emerging and principal risks that require particular \\nattention. During the year, these were:\\n•  the risk of hostile or malicious acts exploiting \\nvulnerabilities in Network Rail’s cyber systems\\n\\n•  the risk of being unable to produce a robust timetable \\n\\nthat is both high quality and high performance\\n\\n•  the risk of failing to manage the competence of Network \\n\\nRail’s employees\\n\\n•  the risk of failing to deliver and embed the outcomes and \\n\\nbenefits of the Putting Passengers First programme \\n•  the risk of the railway not meeting normal levels of \\n\\nperformance during adverse and extreme weather events, \\ntoday and in the future as a result of climate change\\n•  the opportunity to transform how we operate through \\n\\nthe Putting Passengers First programme to create more \\nlocalised decision making \\n\\n•  there was an exceptional business continuity planning \\nsession in relation to Network Rail’s Covid-19 response.\\n\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   115\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nEvaluating the effectiveness \\nof internal control and risk \\nmanagement systems\\n\\nThe committee regularly reviews the corporate risk profile, \\nincluding the status of mitigating actions, and reviews and \\napproves any changes to the enterprise risk management \\n(ERM) framework, which determines the design, \\nimplementation, monitoring and review and identification \\nof risks. \\n\\nDuring the year the committee also reviewed and approved \\nchanges to Network Rail’s risk appetite statements and \\nreviewed the remit of Risk Management to ensure it \\nremained appropriate for the company’s strategy.

It also discusses major findings \\nof internal investigations and management’s response  \\nto them.\\n\\nIn February 2021 the committee assured the Board that \\nthe whistleblowing policy and procedures were adequate \\nand effective. The committee was updated on action taken \\nto further enhance the existing framework in the year. This \\nincluded:\\n•  distributing posters and wallet cards to promote Network \\nRail’s confidential reporting service (known as ‘Speak \\nOut’)\\n\\n•  testing staff confidence in the whistleblowing \\n\\narrangements in the biennial employee engagement \\nsurvey. The results indicate that a large majority of staff \\nhave confidence in the arrangements\\n\\n116   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\n•  an independent review of the whistleblowing policy and \\n\\nprocedures, leading to the policy being updated to reflect \\nthe review’s recommendations. The policy was published \\nin spring 2020\\n\\n•  implementing an upgraded Speak Out system, which \\n\\nincluded improved wording, question sets and analytics\\n\\n•  publishing an updated Speak Out policy, which  \\n\\nincluded new sections on anonymous vs confidential \\nreporting, how to raise a grievance, and signposting to \\nadditional support\\n\\n•  including Speak Out as a company-wide process within \\n\\nthe information management system programme.\\n\\nNetwork Rail’s confidential reporting service and Speak Out \\npolicy has been in place since 2012. The Speak Out service \\nis run by an external company on behalf of Network Rail, \\nand all reports undergo an initial review by our counter \\nfraud and investigation services team.\\n\\nIn 2020/21, 387 confidential reports were made to the \\nSpeak Out service, which is broadly consistent with the \\nnumber of reports made in 2019/20, albeit a slightly \\nreduced figure which has been attributed to the pandemic. \\nEach year, on average, 49 per cent of reports made are \\nsubstantiated and action taken.\\n\\nTraining modules are in place, designed to enhance our \\npeople’s knowledge and understanding of business ethics, \\nincluding information about our whistleblowing policy \\nand how to report concerns.

We \\nlost income from track access payments and our property \\nassets. So we had to make some very hard decisions, \\nincluding limiting pay awards and payments under the \\nperformance related pay scheme. \\n\\nIn 2021/22 we face difficult decisions again as we begin \\nto understand what our passenger and freight profile will \\nlook like. \\n\\nI would like to welcome Fiona Ross as a member of the \\ncommittee, and Michael Harrison who becomes a full \\nmember of the committee having been an observer since \\nMay 2017. \\n\\nThe nomination and remuneration committee is a \\nsingle committee.

The nomination and remuneration \\ncommittee, which has been combined since 2018, is dedicated to the highest standards of disclosure on remuneration \\nand recognises that executive pay is an important issue for a public body. We operate in line with the remuneration \\nrequirements which apply to all UK listed companies and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The \\ncommittee follows good governance practice by reviewing the terms of reference every year.\\n\\nThe 2020 report was approved at the Annual General Meeting by our member, the Secretary of State for Transport (SoS), \\nalong with the current three-year remuneration policy for executive directors (Policy), which is the framework for how \\nexecutive directors are paid. This Policy was included in the 2020 directors’ remuneration report and can also be found on \\nour website www.networkrail.co.uk.\\n\\nKey agenda items for the year\\n\\nOur annual remuneration report outlines the outcomes for the 2021 financial year in terms of executive remuneration.  \\nThe key points to note for 2020/21 outcomes are:\\n•  In the light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally, as a result of \\nthe Covid-19 pandemic, Network Rail’s chair, Sir Peter Hendy, and chief executive, Andrew Haines, both took a voluntary \\nreduction in their remuneration of 20% for four months from December 2020 to March 2021.\\n\\n•  A decision on the 2020/21 performance related pay scheme had not been agreed at time of this report. However, in \\nlight of the financial pressures mentioned above, the chief executive and chief financial officer declined to accept a \\nperformance related payment this year.\\n\\nThe rest of this statement explains how executive remuneration is determined at Network Rail and gives more details on the \\noutcomes of this year.\\n\\nImplementation of Policy in 2021\\n\\nAll decisions made by the committee during the year were \\nin compliance with the Policy. The Policy is based on four \\nkey principles:\\n1.  Simple: the framework should be transparent and simple \\n\\nthe individual. At the same time, we need to ensure value \\nfor money for the taxpayer and to reflect our status as a \\npublicly funded body.\\n\\n3.  Performance and safety: there should be a performance \\n\\nfor all stakeholders to understand.\\n\\n2.  Competitive and fair: attracting and retaining \\n\\nleaders of the necessary ability requires remuneration \\narrangements that are reasonable in the markets that \\nwe compete in for talent, and which fairly reflect the \\nappropriate market rates for the skills and experience of \\n\\nrelated element of the package which rewards \\nperformance in areas that are most important for our \\nstakeholders. There shouldn’t be a reward for failure. \\nThe safety of our workforce, passengers and the general \\npublic is at the heart of everything we do and must be \\nreflected in the remuneration framework.\\n\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   123\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\n4.  Aligned across Network Rail: where possible, remuneration structures will be aligned across the organisation. All \\n\\nNetwork Rail employees continue to be eligible for performance related pay, determined using a consistent performance \\nframework across the organisation, although it is not a contractual entitlement.\\n\\nThe remuneration framework for executive directors agreed in 2020 is based on these principles and includes the  \\nfollowing elements:\\n\\nSalary\\n\\nPension\\n\\nSalaries are set at a level which reflects the skills and experience of the individual as well as \\nthe scope of the responsibilities of the role.\\n\\nParticipation in pension schemes is on the same basis as other managerial positions at \\nNetwork Rail.\\n\\nPerformance related pay\\n\\nOur plan is based on the achievement of stretching annual performance targets, which is \\naligned to the business scorecard.\\n\\n2020/21 outcomes for  \\nexecutive directors \\n\\nBusiness performance is measured through the scorecards. \\nThese evaluate performance against key measures \\nand targets that have been agreed with customers and \\nstakeholders. Since 2019/20, the reference for performance \\nrelated pay (PRP) was changed to a dashboard with \\nsimpler, more outcome-focussed set of measures, that \\nNetwork Rail’s stakeholders, especially passengers, would \\nsee as a success. The measures on the dashboard and the \\nbusiness scorecards are aligned. PRP for senior employees \\nuses the national dashboard outturn and one quarter \\n(25 per cent) of PRP is also determined by an individual’s \\nperformance rating. This gives a direct line of sight between \\nthe achievement of individual objectives and PRP.\\n\\nOverall National scorecard performance was below target \\nat 40.4 per cent. The PRP dashboard outturn was slightly \\nlower at 37.6 per cent.\\n\\nAt the time of publication, as we continue to assess the \\nfinancial and economic consequences of the Covid-19 \\npandemic, a decision on the PRP outcome for 2020/21 has \\nnot been made. However, the chief executive and the chief \\nfinancial officer have both declined a PRP payment for the year.\\n\\nFurther details of the PRP scheme can be found on page 126.\\n\\n124   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\nNational dashboard\\n\\nThere is a distinct set of performance measures set \\nspecifically for performance related pay, and whilst these \\nare different from the measures on business scorecards, \\nthey have been chosen to closely mirror overall business \\nperformance. The measures on the dashboard represent \\nthe key strategic themes of train service delivery, safety, \\nefficiencies and people.\\n\\nDavid Noyes,\\nchair, nomination and remuneration committee\\n15 July 2021\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nANNUAL \\nREMUNERATION REPORT\\n\\nThis report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule \\n8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) \\n(Amendment) Regulations 2013.

In light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Andrew \\n\\nHaines’ took a voluntary reduction in remuneration of 20% for four periods from December 2020 to March 2021.\\n\\n5.  In the light of the financial pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the executive directors declined to receive a payment under the PRP 2020/21 scheme.\\nPay Ratios (audited)\\n\\nThe Government announced new legislation for employers \\nto publish their pay ratios from 2020.

A \\nhistorical record will be published incrementally to a 10-\\nyear period moving forward.\\n\\nFor transparency and good governance, the nomination \\nand remuneration committee decided to publish the pay \\nratio information a year early in the 2018/19 report and to \\n\\nalso publish the information from 2017/18 so that it could \\nbe compared. \\n\\nThere are three calculation methodologies to choose from:\\nA. Calculate total remuneration for all employees and take \\nthe percentiles to calculate the pay ratio against the \\nchief executive single figure total remuneration.\\n\\nB.

Change of chief executive during the year. Pay ratio based on Mark Carne CBE and Andrew Haines OBE’s combined single figure total for 2018/19\\n\\n3. Andrew Haines OBE’s single figure total was used for 2019/20.\\n\\nWhen taking the employee data for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, the total remuneration figure has been calculated \\nbased on an office worker at these percentiles rather than other employee groups. Using a front-line or operations worker \\nwould have reduced the ratio as these types of roles can be eligible for overtime, allowances and shift payments, all of \\nwhich would have increased the comparator pay and decreased the ratio. The additional payments are not guaranteed and \\ntherefore likely to change each year. The total remuneration figure for an office worker at these percentiles is likely to be \\nlower and also less variable year on year. It is therefore considered to be a better comparator.\\n\\nWhilst the pay ratio for the 25th percentile has decreased since last year, this has not been the case for the median and \\n75th percentile. The employees selected in these percentiles were in management roles who were not given a pay award \\nduring 2020/21, which has impacted the pay ratios in comparison to the previous year. \\n\\nExecutive director changes\\n\\nThere have been no changes this year.\\n\\nIncentive plan 2020/21 – annual performance related pay (audited) \\n\\nDuring the year, two directors were eligible to participate \\nin this scheme; Jeremy Westlake and Andrew Haines OBE. \\nThe maximum potential annual performance related \\npay award for Jeremy Westlake in 2020/21 was 20 per \\ncent of salary. Andrew Haines OBE’s maximum potential \\nannual performance related pay award was nine per \\ncent. Stretching performance targets were set at the start \\nof the year in the context of the PRP dashboard. The \\napproach for performance related pay is aligned across the \\nbusiness, including executive directors. The PRP dashboard \\noutturn, which is closely related to the business scorecard, \\ndetermines the percentage pay-out against the maximum \\naward. For 2020/21, one quarter (25 per cent) of PRP \\nwas based on an individual’s performance rating, and \\n\\neach rating carried a different percentage weighting. For \\nexample, a ‘good’ performance rating will have an 11.25 \\nper cent contribution to the overall PRP.\\n\\nPerformance against the national scorecard is summarised \\non pages 26 to 29. Our National scorecard performance \\nwas below target at 40.4 per cent. We benefited from the \\nreduced timetable – we had fewer passengers and ran \\nfewer trains. This resulted in better than planned train \\nperformance, and it also allowed us to finish ahead of \\nour budgeted renewals work. Overall performance was \\nimpacted by the workforce fatalities we have had this year, \\ncoupled with the impact of the Stonehaven derailment. \\nDue to Covid-19, no network wide passenger satisfaction \\n\\n126   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\nsurveys were undertaken in the year and as a result the \\npassenger satisfaction measure was set at zero per cent.\\nThe Performance-Related Pay (PRP) dashboard outturn is \\nslightly lower than our National scorecard at 37.6 per cent. \\nThis is partly due to our performance against two index \\nmeasures not captured in the PRP dashboard; to measure \\nour environmental sustainability and how we handle \\ncomplaints, offset by the weighting we have given to the \\nfinancial performance in the PRP dashboard. In addition, \\neach year the safety, health and environment committee \\n\\n(SHEC) considers the overall outturn from a safety \\nperspective and decides whether to recommend any further \\nadjustments to reflect safety performance.\\n\\nHaving reviewed the outturns of the safety measures and \\nthe overall safety performance, the committee concluded \\nthat no further adjustments were required besides setting \\nthe Passenger Safety measure to zero (agreed earlier in the \\nyear to recognise the impact of the Stonehaven derailment \\nand associated fatalities).\\n\\nPension (audited) \\n\\n1.  Executive directors are eligible to participate in one of the Network Rail defined benefit pension schemes or the defined \\n\\ncontribution pension scheme on the same basis as other employees.\\n\\n2.  Under the existing executive pension policy, Jeremy Westlake is entitled to an allowance in lieu of pension on the same \\n\\nbasis as other employees of Network Rail, subject to the discretion of the group HR director. This allowance is equivalent \\nto the employer’s pension contributions otherwise payable, minus an adjustment for the cost of providing continued \\nlife assurance and the employer National Insurance Contributions payable. Andrew Haines OBE was not eligible to an \\nallowance in lieu of pension as part of his appointment.\\n\\n3.  Previously, executive directors received an additional pension allowance in the form of a cash supplement based on a \\n\\npercentage of their earnings above the notional earnings cap (£170,400 for 2021/21 tax year and previously £166,200 \\nfor 2019/20). This policy no longer applies to new appointments.\\n\\nThe table below sets out details for executive directors for 2021 in respect of all Network Rail pension benefits, split between \\nthe defined benefit and defined contribution/additional allowance.

Under that law the \\ndirectors have prepared the group and company financial \\nstatements in accordance with International Financial \\nReporting Standards (IFRSs). Under company law the \\ndirectors must not approve the financial statements unless \\nthey are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the \\nstate of affairs of the group and the company, and of the \\nprofit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these \\nfinancial statements, the directors are required to:\\n•  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them \\n\\nconsistently\\n\\n•  make judgements and accounting estimates that are \\n\\nreasonable and prudent\\n\\n•  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, \\nsubject to any material departures disclosed and \\nexplained in the financial statements.\\n\\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting \\nrecords that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s \\ntransactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any \\ntime the financial position of the company and the group. This \\nenables them to ensure that the financial statements and the \\ndirectors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies \\nAct 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements, \\nArticle 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for \\nsafeguarding the assets of the company and the group, and \\n\\nCorporate governance\\n\\nhence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and \\ndetection of fraud and other irregularities.\\n\\nLegislation in the UK governing the preparation and \\ndistribution of financial statements may differ from \\nlegislation in other jurisdictions.\\n\\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and \\nintegrity of the company’s website.\\n\\nThe directors consider that the annual report and accounts, \\ntaken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and \\nprovides the information necessary for its member to assess \\nthe company’s performance, business model and strategy.\\n\\nEach of the directors in office at the date of this report, \\nwhose names and functions are listed on pages 90 to 93 \\nconfirm that to the best of their knowledge:\\n•  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the \\napplicable set of accounting standards, give a true and \\nfair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and \\nprofit of the group and the undertakings included in the \\nconsolidation taken as a whole\\n\\n•  the management report is incorporated into the \\n\\nstrategic report and directors’ report for the purposes \\nof the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.8R). \\nIt includes a fair review of the development and \\nperformance of the business and the position of the \\ngroup and the undertakings included in the consolidation \\ntaken as a whole, together with a description of the \\nprincipal risks and uncertainties that the group faces.\\n\\nIndependent auditor\\n\\nResolutions for the re-appointment of the current independent \\nauditor, the National Audit Office, who also acts for the \\nComptroller and Auditor General, and to authorise the audit \\nand risk committee (ARC) to determine the independent \\nauditor’s remuneration, will be proposed at the forthcoming \\nannual general meeting. The notice of meeting is enclosed, \\ntogether with explanatory notes, in a pack with this report.\\n\\nDisclosure of information to the \\nindependent auditor \\n\\nEach of the directors at the date of approval of this report \\nconfirms that: \\n•  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit \\n\\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   135\\n\\n\\x0cCorporate governance\\n\\ninformation of which the company’s independent auditor \\nis unaware\\n\\n•  the director has taken all the steps that they ought to \\nhave taken as a director in order to make them aware \\nof any relevant audit information and to establish that \\nthe company’s independent auditor is aware of that \\ninformation.\\n\\nGoing concern statement\\n\\nThe group’s business activities, together with the factors \\nlikely to affect its future development, performance and \\nposition and the group’s principal risks and uncertainties \\nare set out in the strategic report section, pages 10 to 88. \\nThe financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity \\nposition and borrowing facilities are described in the CFO’s \\nreview, pages 30 to 34. Note 25 to the accounts on page \\n183 includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes \\nfor managing its capital; its financial risk management \\nobjectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging \\nactivities; and its exposures to credit, liquidity and foreign \\nexchange risk. The viability statement on page 87 sets out a \\nlonger-term assessment than this going concern statement.\\n\\nThe group has considerable financial resources together \\nwith long-term contracts with a number of customers  \\nand suppliers.\\n\\nBusiness plans and financial models are used to project \\ncash flows and monitor financial risks and liquidity \\npositions, forecast funding requirements and other key \\nfinancial ratios, including those relevant to our network \\nlicence. Analysis is undertaken to understand the resilience \\nof the group and its business model to the potential impact \\nof the group’s principal risks, or a combination of those \\nrisks. This analysis takes account of the mitigating actions \\nrealistically to be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or \\noccurrence of the underlying risks. In considering the likely \\neffectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s \\nregular monitoring and review of risk management and \\ninternal control systems, as described on pages 77 to 86, \\nare disclosed in detail.\\n\\nConsequently, the directors believe that the group is well \\nplaced to manage its business risks.\\n\\nAfter making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable \\nexpectation that the company and the group have \\nadequate resources to continue in operational existence for \\nthe foreseeable future.\\n\\n136   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n\\nFor this reason and on the basis of the above, the directors \\nconsider it appropriate for the group to adopt the going \\nconcern basis in preparing its annual report and accounts.\\n\\nPost Balance sheet events\\n\\nNetwork Rail’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has \\nbeen discussed throughout the report, including the chief \\nexecutive’s report on page 12 and the risk management \\nreport on pages 77 to 88. Regional responses to the crisis \\nhave also been highlighted on pages 36 to 55.\\n\\nThe Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail and its plans to reform \\nthe rail industry were published after the balance sheet \\ndate. This proposes that, commencing in late 2023, a \\nnew public body, Great British Railways, will integrate the \\nrailways, owning the infrastructure, collecting fare revenue, \\nrunning, and planning the network, and setting most fares \\nand timetables. It is planned that Network Rail will be \\nabsorbed into the public body to bring about single, unified, \\nand accountable leadership for the national network. At this \\nstage it is not likely that this reform will involve the winding \\nup of Network Rail Limited but in any event Great British \\nRailways will assume the existing functions of Network \\nRail Limited as well as have a wider range of powers and \\nfunctions. The transformation programme is dependent on \\nfurther activities including legislation and will take time to \\nfully deliver. \\n\\nThe change in corporation tax rates, to 25% from 19% \\n(effective from April 2023), was substantively enacted in \\nthe Finance Bill 2021 after the balance sheet date. It is \\nestimated that this will increase the deferred tax provision \\nby £1.0bn and will be reflected in next year’s accounts.\\n\\nAside from the above, as at the date of signing these \\nfinancial statements there have not been any significant \\npost balance sheet events, whether adjusting or non-\\nadjusting.\\n\\nStuart Kelly,\\nGroup general counsel and company secretary\\n15 July 2021\\n\\n\\x0c'"

Throughout 2020/21, we’ve ensured that our governance arrangements are \\n appropriate to the range of challenges we’ve faced. We’ve acted on external feedback and \\n corporate governance reviews to maintain a high standard of governance.\\n \\n Covid-19 governance\\n \\n Devolution\\n \\n In response to the pandemic we activated our Strategic \\n Crisis Management Team (SCMT). Led by the director \\n of Network Services, the SCMT includes colleagues from \\n across the organisation and is responsible for managing the \\n impact of coronavirus on the railway, our passengers and \\n our people. The SCMT initially met daily, and then weekly, \\n to coordinate the continuity of the company’s business and \\n keep the railway open. \\n \\n The SCMT has been supported by the National Alert \\n Coordination Group, which manages the logistical response \\n to the pandemic within Network Rail. This included \\n ensuring our workforce had the right personal protective \\n equipment to continue working safely and coordinating our \\n testing programme to provide an extra layer of protection \\n for our people. Command structures within our regions and \\n directorates also implemented necessary policy changes \\n and managed day-to-day issues. \\n \\n With the Rail Delivery Group, we created the Joint Executive \\n Oversight Team where we worked to coordinate an industry-\\n wide response. And the Rail Industry Coronavirus Forum set \\n up Emergency Working Principles Agreements that enabled \\n Network Rail and the trades unions to prioritise activities \\n and work more quickly.\\n \\n Our Board, its committees and the executive leadership \\n team have continued to meet online to ensure we meet the \\n needs of the railway. See page 15 for more on our response \\n to the pandemic.\\n \\n In 2019 we started our Putting Passengers First journey with a \\n reorganisation. We devolved accountabilities and established \\n platforms for us to deliver value for money to those we serve. \\n We’ve made good progress, with new ways of working already \\n reaping rewards for our customers and passengers.\\n \\n Because of the added challenges caused by the pandemic, \\n we’ve re organised ourselves to strengthen devolution \\n and be more agile and efficient. To give us fewer network-\\n wide functions at executive level, we’ve transferred the \\n responsibilities of both Network Services and the Group \\n Transformation team into other existing network-wide \\n functions.\\n \\n Network Services provided services to our routes and regions, \\n as well as network-wide operational oversight. We’ve put \\n Network Services’ route/region services together with Route \\n Services so there’s one place for interaction with internal \\n customers, routes and regions. And to support better \\n oversight and decision making across the full performance \\n cycle of the railway, we’ve moved Network Services’ activities \\n that help the rail network operate effectively as a system \\n into System Operator. We believe this will provide the best \\n operational service for our customers and passengers.\\n \\n There were previously teams leading on transformation at \\n a network-wide level in Group Transformation and within \\n Network Services. We’ve now transferred these teams to \\n Group HR.\\n \\n For more information on our Putting Passengers First \\n programmee se page 20.\\n \\n 94   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cRail Reform\\n \\n On 20 May 2021 the Government published “Great British \\n Railways: Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail – White Paper”. \\n It shows how the Government “will make railways the \\n backbone of a cleaner, more environmentally friendly and \\n modern public transport system across the country.\\n \\n “By replacing franchising, accelerating innovation and \\n integrating the railways, Great British Railway will deliver an \\n efficient, financially sustainable railway that meets the needs \\n of passengers and those who rely on rail on a daily basis.”\\n \\n The Board fully supports the Williams-Shapps Plan for \\n Rail and will work closely with industry partners and key \\n stakeholders to deliver its objectives.\\n \\n Engaging with our stakeholders\\n \\n At Network Rail we consider our stakeholders to be at the \\n heart of our strategy. The interests of key stakeholders \\n and the matters set out in section 172 of the Companies \\n Act 2006 (i.e. promoting success of the company) \\n (see pages 24 to 25) have been considered in Board \\n discussions and decision making. \\n \\n The Putting Passengers First programme was built on an \\n extensive listening exercise. We listened to a wide variety \\n of stakeholders to help us understand what the company \\n does well and where it needs to improve. We engaged with \\n more than 300 colleagues at all levels, across the country, \\n including frontline and office based, as well as external \\n partners and organisations. The outcomes informed our \\n Putting Passengers First programme.\\n \\n Railway supervisory boards comprising Network Rail, train \\n operating companies, Transport Focus, and other key \\n stakeholders provide forums for discussions to identify \\n opportunities to improve the experience of all passengers \\n and freight users. The aim of these boards is to bring \\n track and train closer together. Meetings were held in the \\n Western route, Wales route, Anglia route, West Coast Main \\n Line, and Chilterns; the System Operator Advisory Board \\n provides a similar function.\\n \\n Engaging with our workforce\\n \\n We recognise that employees who feel actively engaged with \\n the company, its purpose, vision and strategy and who feel \\n \\n Corporate governance\\n \\n listened to, are more likely to feel that their work is meaningful \\n and will make a difference for users of the railway.\\n \\n Since its development, the Network Rail Story (see page \\n 8) has been the foundation of our workforce engagement. \\n We’ve a wide range of initiatives through which we engage \\n with our people, including:\\n •  Putting Passengers First programme;\\n •  systems thinking interventions;\\n •  listening programmes;\\n •  business briefings;\\n •  employee networks;\\n •  reverse mentoring\\n •  Trade Union engagement; and\\n •  employee newsletters (The Network and Front Line Focus).\\n \\n As well as this, we use regular employee engagement \\n surveys to understand what our people are thinking and \\n feeling at a given time. The surveys show whether there has \\n been an improvement compared with previous years, and if \\n further action is needed. There are three surveys each year. \\n In 2021 there will be a full Your Voice survey, and two Your \\n Voice pulse surveys focussing on progress and direction. \\n Our Board is briefed on the outcome of the surveys and \\n considers any actions required. Our routes and functions \\n also run additional, locally focussed surveys if needed. \\n \\n See How we engage with our stakeholders on pages 24 and \\n 25 for more information on how and why we engage with  \\n our workforce.\\n \\n The Network Rail Board\\n \\n During 2020/21, the Board focussed much of its time on:\\n •  our six strategic priorities (see page 21)\\n •  the industry response to the pandemic\\n •  the environmental sustainability strategy\\n •  workforce safety\\n \\n During 2021/22, it’s anticipated that the Board’s focus will \\n be on:\\n •  workforce safety/Safety Task Force\\n •  earthworks/weather resilience/environmental \\n \\n sustainability strategy\\n \\n •  industry recovery from the pandemic and the return of \\n \\n passengers\\n \\n •  Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail\\n •  updated freight strategy”\\n \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   95\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n Compliance with the UK corporate governance code\\n \\n The Board believes that in 2020/21 the company \\n fulfilled the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate \\n Governance Code 2018, except for the following provisions \\n that it’s unable to comply with, mainly due to our status as \\n an arm’s length body of the Government:\\n •  provision 5: relating to the prescribed methods of \\n engagement with employees. The three options \\n suggested by the code were considered by the Board. \\n However, each was discounted as an appropriate method \\n for Network Rail because our workforce engagement \\n activities already go beyond the requirements of the \\n code; \\n \\n •  provision 9: in respect of appointment of the chair.

New directors are provided with key corporate, \\n strategic and financial documents to familiarise them with \\n the company’s business. The induction programme includes \\n individual meetings with Board members, the group general \\n counsel and company secretary, senior executives and other \\n key stakeholders. \\n \\n Succession Planning\\n The Board and the nomination and remuneration committee \\n considers whether the appointment process and the approach \\n to succession planning supports a diverse and sustainable \\n pipeline of talent for senior roles within the business. \\n The Board recognises that effective talent management \\n programmes are necessary to improve diversity within all \\n levels of the company and are essential for the delivery of the \\n company’s long-term strategy and objectives.\\n \\n Board and executive diversity\\n The Board is aware that diversity extends beyond gender, \\n and includes amongst other things age, social, ethnic, \\n educational and professional backgrounds. Further details \\n about Network Rail’s organisational diversity and inclusion \\n policies and how these have been implemented in the year \\n can be found in the Our people section, page 67.\\n \\n We know that to truly put passengers first, empower our \\n people and make them proud to work here, our senior \\n leadership needs to be reflective of our passengers, our \\n people and the communities we serve. That’s why the Board \\n approved Network Rail’s first Board diversity and inclusion \\n policy in February 2021. The policy notes the company’s \\n long-term ambitions in relation to board diversity and \\n specific objectives to progress towards them. These include \\n that, by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, at least one \\n third of the Board will be female and one of the directors \\n will be from a BAME background.\\n \\n The policy is supplementary to the organisational equality, \\n diversity and inclusion policy and the Everyone Matters \\n diversity strategy, and implements their aspirations in the \\n context of our senior leaders. The full policy can be found \\n on the Network Rail website www.networkrail.co.uk. \\n \\n The Board is comprised of ten non-executive directors and \\n two executive directors. These individuals come from a \\n \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   101\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n variety of backgrounds and experience. The Board is 83 per cent male and 17 per cent female, however, when considering \\n non-executive directors only, the split is 80 per cent male and 20 per cent female.\\n \\n The following chart shows the length of service of the non-executive directors.\\n \\n 0-2 Years: 5 NEDs\\n \\n 3-4 years: 2 NEDs\\n \\n 5-6 years: 3 NEDs\\n \\n 7-9 years: 0 NEDs\\n \\n Board effectiveness\\n \\n The Board is committed to maintaining the highest \\n standards of corporate governance. In line with best practice, \\n Manchester Square Partners (MSP) undertook a review of the \\n effectiveness of the Network Rail Board in early 2021.\\n \\n The process involved one-to-one interviews with Board \\n members and the group general counsel and company \\n secretary. Executive leadership team members,  \\n colleagues at the DfT, ORR and Transport Scotland were \\n also interviewed.\\n \\n and more strategic matters was appropriate. It was \\n acknowledged that some of the technical, operational \\n matters had a strategic element to them; \\n \\n 2. given the Board’s complex and busy agenda, careful \\n \\n attention should be paid to the resilience and capacity \\n of individuals to effectively manage a substantial volume \\n of work. In this context it was important that succession \\n plans for senior and business critical roles were regularly \\n reviewed for both planned and unplanned situations; and\\n \\n 3. the importance of giving the Board sufficient time for \\n reflection and discussion that was not driven by an \\n agenda or the need to make decisions. \\n \\n MSP reviewed Board and committee meeting papers and \\n observed the March 2021 Board meeting. A report on the \\n review, including recommendations, was provided to the \\n Board in July 2021.\\n \\n An action plan was being developed to address these \\n findings. The action plan, and progress against delivering \\n it, would be agreed/monitored by the nomination and \\n remuneration committee.\\n \\n The key findings of MSP’s board effectiveness review are set \\n out below.\\n \\n The key finding from the review was that the Board was “an \\n exceptionally busy and demanding one with a challenging \\n and content rich agenda … overall performance is \\n deemed strong”. Manchester Square Partners’ primary \\n recommendations to make the Board even more effective \\n included:\\n 1. the Board should consider whether the balance between \\n \\n technical, operational matters coming to the Board \\n \\n Professional development, training \\n and support for directors\\n \\n Board members are offered a range of training and \\n development opportunities each year to support their \\n continuing professional development. Directors often \\n receive corporate governance and legal updates, as \\n appropriate.\\n \\n 102   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n Regional managing directors and function heads regularly attend Board meetings to provide updates on the key issues \\n affecting their areas of the business.\\n \\n The directors have access to the advice and services of the group general counsel and company secretary, who is responsible \\n for compliance with Board procedures and the provision of information to the Board in a timely manner. The directors have \\n the right to seek independent professional advice at reasonable expense to Network Rail.\\n \\n In November 2020 the Board was briefed on the periodic review (PR) process, ahead of PR23. Periodic reviews are one \\n of the principal mechanisms by which the ORR holds Network Rail to account and secures value for money for users and \\n funders of the railway. PR23 will determine what Network Rail should deliver in our role of operating, maintaining and \\n renewing the network in Control Period 7, which will run from April 2024 – March 2029. The briefing considered Network \\n Rail’s regulatory environment and the Board’s role in the PR process.\\n \\n Election and re-election of directors\\n \\n Each of the directors is subject to (re-) election at the 2021 \\n AGM. The Board considers that all directors act in good \\n faith, for the long-term benefit and success of Network Rail, \\n and continue to perform effectively.\\n \\n Directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability \\n insurance\\n \\n Network Rail maintains D&O liability insurance. Network \\n Rail did not indemnify any directors during 2020/21.\\n \\n Directors’ conflict of interest\\n \\n The Annual General Meeting (AGM)\\n \\n The Board identifies and manages potential conflicts of \\n interests that directors may have. Each Board meeting \\n begins with disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. At \\n the date of this report, the following key potential conflicts \\n of interest have been declared:\\n •  Michael Harrison is director of UK Investments at UKGI;\\n •  Mike Putnam is a member of Arcadis NV’s supervisory \\n \\n board;\\n \\n •  Fiona Ross is a non-executive director at The Scottish \\n \\n Government; and\\n \\n •  Neil Sachdev, non-executive director of Network Rail’s \\n \\n Property Supervisory Committee, is chair of the East West \\n Rail Company Limited.\\n \\n The formal business of the AGM is set out in a number \\n of separate resolutions to be considered at the meeting. \\n The company’s sole member, the Secretary of State \\n for Transport, is provided with a copy of the notice of \\n meeting, alongside the annual report and accounts (as is \\n the National Audit Office). The Secretary of State can vote \\n either for or against a resolution or can withhold his vote \\n (although the law does not class a withheld vote to be a \\n vote).

Running a safe railway will always be \\n our priority. We want everyone to feel safe whether they’re \\n working on, living near, or travelling on the railway. We’ve \\n worked tirelessly to keep our passengers and workforce safe \\n during the Covid-19 pandemic, while operating a railway to \\n help key workers, transport much needed freight goods, and \\n keep the rest of the country running.\\n \\n The pandemic had a major impact on our safety \\n performance this year. And we have been strengthening \\n how we support mental health and wellbeing. At the end of \\n 2020/21, 20 per cent of line managers had been trained. \\n This is a 10 per cent increase on 2019/20. Because we’ve \\n been socially distancing colleagues we’ve had more vehicles \\n on the road; life-saving rules breaches rose and were mostly \\n related to employees speeding in road vehicles. \\n \\n Tragically, three people lost their lives on the 12 August \\n 2020 when a train derailed at Carmont, near Stonehaven. \\n Brett McCullough was driving the train, Donald Dinnie was \\n a conductor, and Christopher Stuchbury was a passenger. \\n In response, Network Rail set up two new external task \\n forces, one aimed at its response to severe weather events, \\n and the other aimed at management of earthworks and \\n drainage along the railway.\\n \\n The number of suicides and trespass incidents that took \\n place on the railway was slightly below that of the previous \\n year. Our partnership with Learn Live has educated over ten \\n million children and young people in schools and colleges \\n nationally, on the dangers associated with railway trespass; \\n this has coincided with an encouraging reduction in reported \\n child trespass. The remit for this relationship has now been \\n extended to include level crossing and station safety.\\n \\n Sadly, there were also three workforce fatalities in the year. \\n On 8 April 2020 Aden Ashurst, working for AmcoGiffen, \\n was struck by a train at Roade. On 30 November 2020, \\n Kevin Mauger was fatality injured at the Long-Welded Rail \\n Facility in Eastleigh. On 9 February 2021, Tyler Byrne was \\n struck by a train at Surbiton. Investigations are underway \\n to determine the causes and to prevent similar events from \\n ever happening again. \\n \\n The trackworker Safety Task Force has continued its \\n work to improve our people’s safety when working on \\n our tracks through better task planning, increased use of \\n safety equipment, and through the eradication of lookout \\n working. The task force has completed 2,913 out of 6,463 \\n key objectives that are to be delivered by 31 July 2022; \\n and we’ve seen the use of unassisted lookouts decrease by \\n over 75 per cent since July 2019. Near misses involving our \\n workforce have also decreased by half during 2020/21.\\n \\n 104   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n The committee reviewed the safety performance data \\n that makes up part of the performance related pay award \\n for senior executives and made a recommendation to the \\n remuneration committee (see page 126).\\n \\n Mike Putnam,\\n chair, safety, health and environmental \\n compliance committee\\n 15 July 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n Committee members\\n \\n Formal appointment to \\n the committee \\n \\n Number of meetings attended  \\n during the year\\n \\n Mike Putnam\\n \\n Rob Brighouse\\n \\n Sir Peter Hendy\\n \\n David Noyes\\n \\n Feb 2018\\n \\n Jan 2016\\n \\n Oct 2015\\n \\n Dec 2018\\n \\n *  Stephen Duckworth was appointed to the Board and committee on 1 April 2021\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n Committee attendees\\n \\n Several of our executives are invited to attend the \\n committee’s meetings including the chief executive, the \\n group director for the Technical Authority, and the chief \\n quality, health, safety and environment officer. Stephen \\n Duckworth, non-executive director, has a standing invitation \\n to attend meetings. Other executives and external visitors \\n are also invited from time to time to report on specific areas \\n that lie within the committee’s areas of responsibility. \\n \\n The general secretary of the National Union of Rail, \\n Maritime and Transport Workers (the RMT) is invited to \\n attend all meetings. This adds scrutiny and challenge \\n to the committee’s business and is consistent with our \\n commitment to remain transparent to the wider rail \\n industry and its important stakeholders. \\n \\n Ian Prosser CBE, chief inspector of railways and director of \\n railway safety at the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), attends \\n two meetings each year to present the regulator’s view on \\n our safety performance. \\n \\n Role and responsibilities of the \\n committee\\n \\n The environmental aspect of the committee’s role has \\n been redefined since the creation of the environmental \\n sustainability committee in 2020. The SHEC committee \\n now oversees environmental legal and regulatory \\n compliance while the environmental sustainability \\n committee has broader responsibility for environmental \\n strategy and related matters. \\n \\n The committee’s role is to monitor how the company \\n implements its responsibilities on safety and health through \\n its everyday business activities, and how it complies with \\n its environmental obligations. The committee needs to be \\n \\n satisfied that the company’s relevant strategies, policies \\n and procedures are effective, reviewed and adapted as \\n necessary to evolving business activities.\\n \\n What the committee does: \\n •  it reviews the group’s strategies, systems, policies \\n \\n and practices for SHEC.

The regions will continue to develop their own local plans to align with the corporate \\n strategy and reflect the specific challenges and opportunities relevant to their geographical areas.\\n \\n The 2021 committee workplan will involve oversight and review of resourcing to deliver the ambitious plan, and roll out of \\n technology to deliver a cleaner and greener railway. It will also monitor the roll out of electric charging points for electric \\n vehicles; the plan for the next stages of electrification; development of the Social Value Strategy; baselining for whole-life \\n carbon in assets; minimising waste and recycling; and joint plans with supply chain partners targeted at carbon emissions \\n reductions. Network Rail will be supporting the Government as it hosts the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the \\n Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in June 2021.\\n \\n 108   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n PROPERTY SUPERVISORY \\n COMMITTEE REPORT\\n \\n The property supervisory board became a committee of \\n the Network Rail Board in 2020.\\n \\n I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the \\n key activities undertaken during 2020/21, alongside its \\n anticipated activities for 2021/22.\\n \\n Firstly, I’d like to welcome Mark Bayley CBE to the \\n committee. Mark has spent much of his career in the rail \\n sector. He has particular experience in major projects, \\n restructurings and corporate finance. \\n \\n The past year has been incredibly challenging for our \\n retailers, tenants and commercial partners. We have \\n been determined to show them support, care and \\n empathy during the pandemic, while they’ve continued \\n when possible to provide vital goods and services for \\n our passengers, particularly those critical workers who \\n have kept the country moving during the pandemic. In \\n March 2020, we introduced swift and significant financial \\n measures to support retailers in our managed stations \\n and tenants in our commercial estate. These measures \\n have continued throughout 2020/21 and the committee \\n has helped to shape and refine them. We’ve also engaged \\n with the wider rail sector and Government to ensure our \\n financial measures are commensurate and fair. And we’ve \\n championed collective approaches and shared lessons \\n learned during an unprecedented crisis for the sector. \\n \\n We’ve focussed on devolving Property from a national \\n function to a regional model, as part of our wider programme \\n to put passengers first. This key milestone was achieved in \\n September, with five regional property teams established, \\n each led by a regional property director. They are now \\n supported by a smaller group property team, led by our \\n group property director. Group Property provides services and \\n activities to the regions, as well as delivering some activities \\n centrally for reasons of value add, economic and consistency. \\n \\n Embedding property expertise within each region will \\n better align the teams to regional objectives and develop \\n strategies that put passengers first. They’ll do this by \\n \\n optimising the use of operational land, generating capital \\n receipts to reinvest in the railway, releasing land for new \\n homes, and improving conditions and access for our \\n frontline staff.\\n \\n The committee has continued to monitor Network Rail’s \\n overall property performance against its strategy for Control \\n Period 6 (CP6). This has ensured property colleagues across \\n the company continued to focus on supporting the regions \\n to deliver activities, put passengers first, develop sites \\n through partnerships, and deliver land for housing. They’ve \\n also been working with partners to deliver positive railway \\n and community outcomes, and providing great places for \\n businesses and communities to thrive.\\n \\n Sir Peter Hendy CBE,\\n chair, property supervisory committee\\n 15 July 2021\\n \\n Committee \\n members\\n \\n Formal \\n appointment to \\n the committee \\n (formerly \\n Property \\n Supervisory \\n Board)\\n \\n Number of \\n meetings \\n attended  \\n during the year\\n \\n Sir Peter Hendy \\n CBE\\n \\n December 2019\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n Mark Bayley CBE1 October 2020\\n \\n Neil Sachdev MBE July 2016\\n \\n Stephen Smith\\n \\n July 2016\\n \\n 3/6\\n \\n 5/6\\n \\n 6/6\\n \\n 1.

The chief financial officer, group property \\n director, managing director Southern region, and the general counsel for property normally attend meetings by invitation \\n as well as representatives from the Department for Transport, Treasury and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority. Group \\n and regional property directors also attend meetings by invitation. \\n \\n Role and responsibilities of the committee\\n \\n The committee’s role is to consider and provide advice upon:\\n •  the long-term vision and strategies for Network Rail property\\n •  regional property related strategies and the management of them, including reviewing the respective regional property \\n \\n directors’ business plans\\n •  key risks and opportunities\\n •  the performance of the regional property directors and group property team\\n •  subject to the delegated authority to the committee, make decisions or make recommendations\\n •  consider any other matter specifically referred to the committee by the Board or the executive leadership team.\\n \\n Principal activities during the year\\n \\n At each meeting the committee receives detailed property updates for discussion. The group property director provides a \\n written summary of the committee’s activities, the main discussion points, findings, and any recommendations to the Board \\n for its next meeting.\\n \\n Until March 2020 the committee had a programme of site visits in the five regions to tie in with their committee meetings. \\n Due to Covid-19 these visits have been deferred and will be reinstated when it is safe to do so.\\n \\n Other areas of focus during the year have included:\\n \\n London & Continental Railway (LCR)\\n In early 2019 we established a formal collaboration with LCR to explore the potential to redevelop land at and around \\n stations, to deliver land for residential and commercial development, and to generate passenger benefits and money to be \\n reinvested in the operational railway. Updates on the collaboration are given and reviewed at each committee meeting. The \\n chair of LCR attended the September 2020 meeting.\\n \\n Redevelopment of Euston Station\\n The committee has reviewed and provided feedback on the key developments underway at Euston station.\\n \\n Regional Property directors’ reports\\n Following the Putting Passengers First organisational changes, all regional property directors have presented to the \\n committee giving them an overview of regional property strategies, targets and efficiencies.\\n \\n Planned activities for 2021/22\\n \\n In the year ahead, the committee will continue to monitor progress on:\\n •  devolution and the regional property model\\n •  workplace optimisation and the use of our office estate\\n •  Covid-19 recovery, particularly retail remobilisation\\n •  collaboration with LCR and delivering land for housing\\n \\n 110   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n AUDIT AND RISK \\n COMMITTEE REPORT\\n \\n I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the \\n key activities undertaken during 2020/21, alongside its \\n anticipated activities for 2021/22.

The committee also oversees risk \\n management, regulatory reporting and compliance. It \\n makes recommendations to the Board on the level of risk \\n appetite acceptable to the company.\\n \\n Following each meeting, the chair provides a summary \\n of the committee’s activities, main discussion points and \\n findings to the next Board meeting along with a written \\n report provided by the committee secretary, and makes \\n recommendations as appropriate.\\n \\n Principal activities during the year\\n \\n The committee had presentations from four regional \\n managing directors on the key risks affecting their business \\n plans. There were also updates on the Putting Passengers \\n First programme, cyber security, the competence \\n management system, business contingency planning in \\n \\n response to the Covid-19 pandemic, timetabling risks, and \\n weather and climate change resilience.\\n \\n At each meeting the committee receives business updates \\n from group finance, internal audit, group risk and the \\n independent external auditor. In addition to regular updates, \\n the committee considers the emerging and principal risks \\n facing the business and elevates these to the Board where \\n necessary. The committee conducts an annual evaluation of \\n its effectiveness, details of which are provided below.\\n \\n Fair, balanced and understandable\\n \\n Following a review, the audit and risk committee confirmed \\n that the annual report and financial statements for \\n 2020/21 present a fair, balanced and understandable \\n overview and provides the information necessary to assess \\n the company’s position, performance, business model and \\n strategy. The committee therefore proposed the document \\n for approval to the Board.\\n \\n Significant accounting judgements, key assumptions and estimates\\n \\n With the support of the NAO, the committee assessed whether suitable accounting policies had been adopted, whether \\n management had made appropriate estimates and judgements, and disclosures were balanced and fair. The main areas of \\n focus during the year are set out below.\\n \\n Accounting judgments\\n \\n How the committee addressed those judgements\\n \\n Valuation of rail network \\n and compliance with \\n regulatory requirements\\n \\n The revaluation model used to measure the value of the rail network consists of a number of \\n estimates and judgements made both by the company and by the Office of Rail and Road \\n (for example anticipated financial and operational outperformance in the Control Period \\n (CP6). The committee reviewed reports from management on the key estimates and the \\n methodology applied to the revaluation model.\\n \\n The committee also reviewed the work of management and findings of the external \\n auditors in respect of the reasonableness of key judgements and estimates in respect of the \\n forecast for CP6, and the impact of the recent White Paper; and the appropriateness of the \\n associated disclosures in the financial statements.\\n \\n After this review, the committee confirmed the valuation derived from the estimates, key \\n judgments and valuation methodology.\\n \\n 112   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n Capital accruals\\n \\n The estimate of cost of work done is a key judgement in Network Rail’s accounts.\\n \\n Risk of management \\n override of internal \\n controls\\n \\n Deferred tax\\n \\n It was considered \\n whether it was still \\n appropriate for Network \\n Rail not to recognise \\n a deferred tax asset in \\n relation to its brought \\n forward tax losses.\\n \\n Valuation of investment \\n properties\\n \\n Pension assumptions\\n \\n The additions to property, plant and equipment are valued at an estimate of the cost of \\n work done (COWD) in the year to 31 March 2021. To the extent that the COWD is greater \\n than the invoiced amount, fixed asset accruals are recognised based on expected amounts \\n required to settle contractual obligations.\\n \\n To value the COWD on capital projects appropriately, commercial managers with the \\n appropriate level of experience assess the progress to completion of the project at the ex-\\n pected cost. Both progress and expected costs have elements that are estimates and require \\n accounting judgement.\\n \\n Reports on management’s approach to measuring cost of work done were reviewed along-\\n side details of internal validation and the external auditor’s report on sample testing. \\n \\n The independent auditor has focussed attention on this area and provided satisfactory \\n reporting to the committe.\\n \\n The committee agreed not to recognise a deferred tax asset until it was satisfied when it \\n could be exchanged for economic benefits. With the high levels of investment expected for \\n the foreseeable future, the committee saw little prospect that taxable profits would exceed \\n capital allowances, therefore requiring use of tax assets (including losses brought forward) to \\n reduce tax liabilities.\\n \\n Investment properties are stated at fair value. The valuations are based on assumptions and \\n estimates that require judgement. The committee agreed the appropriate methodology had \\n been used. The methodology was consistent with prior years and included valuations and \\n additional assistance from external valuation specialists. The valuations were reviewed by \\n management and the external valuation specialists.\\n \\n The group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. Valuation \\n of the defined benefit schemes is dependent on certain key assumptions and complex ac-\\n tuarial calculations. External actuaries are therefore engaged to assist in advising on key \\n assumptions and determining the value of the pension obligations.\\n \\n The committee noted the conclusion of the triennial valuation in the year. The committee \\n discussed the key assumptions, including the degree to which these were supported by pro-\\n fessional advice from the actuaries. The independent auditor also focussed attention on this \\n area and provided reporting to the committee on this matter.\\n \\n Finally, the committee considered the valuation of the scheme assets, noting the estimation \\n uncertainty associated with Level 3 assets such as private equity holdings. This included a \\n consideration of the work of management and the auditor to take account of movements to \\n the year end, and the focussed work of the auditor in respect of higher risk assets.\\n \\n The committee is required to review any correspondence received from regulators in respect of financial reporting. There \\n has been no correspondence from the FRC or the ORR in relation to Network Rail’s financial reporting during the 2020/21 \\n financial year.\\n \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   113\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n Committee Effectiveness\\n \\n The committee completed a self-evaluation effectiveness \\n review, supported by more detailed interviews with \\n committee members and key attendees. The review has \\n shown that the committee was functioning effectively, \\n and no significant areas of concern were raised. The \\n recommendations are being taken forward to improve the \\n work of the committee.\\n \\n In addition, as part of the Board effectiveness evaluation \\n undertaken in early 2021, feedback was provided on the \\n effectiveness of the committee. No areas of concern related \\n to the committee were raised during this review.\\n \\n The approach taken to the \\n appointment of the external auditor\\n \\n The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), supported \\n by the NAO, was appointed as Network Rail’s independent \\n auditor in 2015. In addition to providing an opinion on \\n the group accounts, the C&AG also audits the individual \\n accounts of Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC, \\n Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and Network Rail (High \\n Speed) Limited.\\n \\n Gareth Davies assumed the post of C&AG on 1 June 2019.\\n \\n PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) acted as the independent \\n auditors for the remaining subsidiaries in 2020/21. \\n The obligation to appoint the C&AG as Network \\n Rail’s independent auditor is a direct impact of the \\n reclassification of Network Rail as an arm’s-length \\n government body and is in line with standard arrangements \\n for other public sector bodies.\\n \\n The company is, therefore, not in a position to comply with \\n the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order or the UK \\n Corporate Governance Code 2018 in respect of tendering \\n prior to the appointment of an auditor and this will remain \\n the company’s position for the foreseeable future.\\n \\n Objectivity and independence of the \\n independent auditor\\n \\n The NAO is independent of Network Rail in accordance with \\n the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of financial \\n \\n 114   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard \\n as applied to listed entities/public interest entities.\\n \\n The committee has put in place safeguards to maintain \\n the independent auditor’s objectivity and independence. \\n To enhance independence and in line with established \\n auditing standards, a new senior statutory auditor of the \\n independent auditor is normally appointed every five years, \\n with other key audit principals within that firm rotated \\n every seven years.\\n \\n The committee has established a policy whereby \\n employment of the independent auditor on other work for \\n the company is prohibited without prior approval by the \\n committee, other than for audit services or tax compliance \\n services. Such requests are unlikely as the NAO does not \\n offer non-audit services. The NAO does carry out value for \\n money assessments for Network Rail, but this does not \\n represent a service to Network Rail as it is performed under \\n statute and on behalf of Parliament.\\n \\n In 2020/21 the fee for audit services was £0.597m \\n (£0.57m in 2019/20). This includes the NAO’s cost of \\n auditing Network Rail Infrastructure Limited, Network Rail \\n Infrastructure Finance plc, Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd, \\n the regulatory accounts and review of interim financial \\n statements of Network Rail Limited and Network Rail \\n Infrastructure Finance plc. It excludes the cost of the audit \\n of some smaller subsidiaries which continue to be audited \\n by PwC.\\n \\n The fee paid to PwC for auditing the smaller subsidiaries \\n was circa £155k in 2020/21 (£150k in 2019/20).\\n \\n Effectiveness of the external auditor\\n \\n A review of the independent auditor’s performance \\n and effectiveness is undertaken as part of the overall \\n effectiveness review of the auditing process. Following \\n the conclusion of the 2020/21 reporting cycle, the \\n auditing process was assessed. The independent auditor \\n was also invited to comment on what worked well and \\n where improvements could be made. The committee was \\n satisfied that the independent auditor was fully effective \\n and performed as expected in discharging its duties and \\n obligations. For the second year, the external audit has \\n been completed in a remote way due to Covid-19 and \\n yet has remained effective with good communication \\n between teams. \\n \\n \\x0cInternal audit\\n \\n The committee approved the annual internal audit plan \\n and reviewed throughout the year to check alignment \\n with the group’s strategic priorities and key risks. At each \\n meeting the director of risk and internal audit updated \\n the committee on any changes to the plan, notable \\n audits, overdue actions, themes, and key issues arising \\n from internal audit’s work. Despite restrictions presented \\n by the pandemic, internal audit activities continued \\n throughout the year and the audit programme was \\n updated based on the assessment of risk in what was a \\n changing environment.\\n \\n In addition to formal risk-based audit, independent reviews \\n have been undertaken to support key programmes and \\n the response to emerging issues. These reviews have \\n included the response to the pandemic, preparations for the \\n UK’s exit from the EU, and the progress of our intelligent \\n infrastructure programme.\\n \\n During the year, a root cause framework has been \\n introduced to identify common themes arising from audit \\n activity. These include:\\n \\n Governance: audits identified cases of less mature \\n governance, risk and control (GRC) frameworks both  \\n in design and operating effectiveness – for example,  \\n in our audits of post-contract management and  \\n stations management.\\n \\n Processes and procedures: audits flagged evidence of \\n gaps that meant the operation of controls could not be \\n demonstrated – for example, in our audits of our joiners-\\n movers-leavers process where system access was not \\n periodically reviewed, and leavers were not removed in a \\n timely manner.\\n \\n Assurance and monitoring: audits found weaknesses in \\n assurance and monitoring arrangements – for example, \\n contract and procurement controls, tunnel evaluations, and \\n monitoring overcrowding incidents at stations.\\n \\n Where areas for improvement have been identified through \\n audit activity, these are being actively managed and \\n the improvements closely monitored by the committee. \\n Examples of improvements include: the governance, risk, \\n assurance and improvement (GRAI) model that is being \\n embedded to strengthen line of sight between the business \\n strategy and how this is to be achieved, and the revised \\n procurement management framework rolled out in 2020.\\n \\n Corporate governance\\n \\n The committee approved the internal audit charter which \\n defines internal audit’s purpose, authority, responsibility \\n and position within the company.\\n \\n Risk management and  \\n internal controls\\n \\n The Board has ultimate responsibility for Network Rail’s risk \\n management and internal control systems, but delegates \\n detailed oversight of the function to the committee, which \\n then reports its findings and makes recommendations to the \\n Board. This covers all material controls including financial, \\n operational and compliance controls and risk management \\n systems. The risk management systems and internal controls \\n are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and \\n can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance \\n that the group’s risks are being appropriately managed \\n and mitigated.

It also discusses major findings \\n of internal investigations and management’s response  \\n to them.\\n \\n In February 2021 the committee assured the Board that \\n the whistleblowing policy and procedures were adequate \\n and effective. The committee was updated on action taken \\n to further enhance the existing framework in the year. This \\n included:\\n •  distributing posters and wallet cards to promote Network \\n Rail’s confidential reporting service (known as ‘Speak \\n Out’)\\n \\n •  testing staff confidence in the whistleblowing \\n \\n arrangements in the biennial employee engagement \\n survey. The results indicate that a large majority of staff \\n have confidence in the arrangements\\n \\n 116   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n •  an independent review of the whistleblowing policy and \\n \\n procedures, leading to the policy being updated to reflect \\n the review’s recommendations. The policy was published \\n in spring 2020\\n \\n •  implementing an upgraded Speak Out system, which \\n \\n included improved wording, question sets and analytics\\n \\n •  publishing an updated Speak Out policy, which  \\n \\n included new sections on anonymous vs confidential \\n reporting, how to raise a grievance, and signposting to \\n additional support\\n \\n •  including Speak Out as a company-wide process within \\n \\n the information management system programme.\\n \\n Network Rail’s confidential reporting service and Speak Out \\n policy has been in place since 2012. The Speak Out service \\n is run by an external company on behalf of Network Rail, \\n and all reports undergo an initial review by our counter \\n fraud and investigation services team.\\n \\n In 2020/21, 387 confidential reports were made to the \\n Speak Out service, which is broadly consistent with the \\n number of reports made in 2019/20, albeit a slightly \\n reduced figure which has been attributed to the pandemic. \\n Each year, on average, 49 per cent of reports made are \\n substantiated and action taken.\\n \\n Training modules are in place, designed to enhance our \\n people’s knowledge and understanding of business ethics, \\n including information about our whistleblowing policy \\n and how to report concerns. To date, the training has been \\n completed by over 41,500 employees.\\n \\n Planned activities for 2021/22\\n \\n In the 2021/22 financial year, the committee will continue \\n its oversight of the risk management and internal control \\n systems and internal audit, monitoring the integrity of the \\n financial statements including the interim statements, and \\n reviewing the external audit process. \\n \\n The committee will focus on ensuring that the structure \\n and focus of meetings adapt to the devolved nature of \\n the organisation and take into account the key challenges \\n facing the organisation and wider industry.

It was \\n difficult for our people; for Network Rail and for the rail \\n industry as a whole; for the national and local governments \\n and for the UK economy.\\n \\n Against this background, I present my report on behalf of \\n the nomination and remuneration committee.\\n \\n In 2020/21 Network Rail’s revenue fell dramatically. We \\n lost income from track access payments and our property \\n assets. So we had to make some very hard decisions, \\n including limiting pay awards and payments under the \\n performance related pay scheme. \\n \\n In 2021/22 we face difficult decisions again as we begin \\n to understand what our passenger and freight profile will \\n look like. \\n \\n I would like to welcome Fiona Ross as a member of the \\n committee, and Michael Harrison who becomes a full \\n member of the committee having been an observer since \\n May 2017. \\n \\n The nomination and remuneration committee is a \\n single committee. However reporting requirements on \\n \\n remuneration matters means we report on the work of \\n the committee in two parts. The first section looks at \\n the ‘nomination’ aspects of the committee’s work, and \\n the latter section reports the prescribed elements of the \\n directors’ remuneration report. There is, of course, some \\n overlap, and this will be highlighted where appropriate.\\n \\n David Noyes,\\n chair, nomination and remuneration committee\\n 15 July 2021\\n \\n Committee members\\n \\n David Noyes\\n \\n Michael Harrison1\\n \\n Sir Peter Hendy\\n \\n Fiona Ross2\\n \\n Formal appointment to \\n the committee \\n \\n Number of meetings attended  \\n during the year\\n \\n October 2018\\n \\n May 2020\\n \\n October 2015\\n \\n September 2020\\n \\n 5/5\\n \\n 3/5\\n \\n 4/5\\n \\n 3/3\\n \\n 1.

It supplements our equality, \\n diversity and inclusion policy and our Everyone Matters \\n diversity strategy and implements their aspirations in the \\n context of our senior leaders. \\n \\n The Board diversity and inclusion policy targets that:\\n •  as a minimum, one third of its directors will be female by \\n \\n the end of the 2021/22 financial year, and\\n \\n The search for new non-executive directors\\n The committee oversaw a new in-house approach to \\n searching for and appointing two new non-executive \\n directors. The key aim was to reach a different group of \\n people than might have applied in previous searches.\\n \\n An open advertising campaign supported a targeted \\n search that saw direct approaches being made to potential \\n applicants. Some of the specific backgrounds against \\n which applicants were researched included technological \\n innovation, climate change impact, diversity and inclusion, \\n the digital future, and passenger insight. \\n \\n Over 350 applicants were screened against the job \\n description criteria. This resulted in 14 candidates being \\n interviewed by Network Rail’s HR team.\\n \\n From that pool, seven candidates were interviewed by \\n non-executive directors, David Noyes and Fiona Ross. The \\n four finalist candidates were interviewed by Sir Peter Hendy, \\n chair of Network Rail, and Ruth Hannant, then Director \\n General (DfT).\\n \\n Following the approval of the Secretary of State for \\n Transport and the Prime Minister, Ismail Amla and \\n Stephen Duckworth OBE were appointed to the Board on \\n 1 April 2021.\\n \\n The induction of newly appointed non-executive directors\\n As reported last year, Fiona Ross and Mark Bayley CBE \\n became directors on 11 May 2020.

The nomination and remuneration \\n committee, which has been combined since 2018, is dedicated to the highest standards of disclosure on remuneration \\n and recognises that executive pay is an important issue for a public body. We operate in line with the remuneration \\n requirements which apply to all UK listed companies and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The \\n committee follows good governance practice by reviewing the terms of reference every year.\\n \\n The 2020 report was approved at the Annual General Meeting by our member, the Secretary of State for Transport (SoS), \\n along with the current three-year remuneration policy for executive directors (Policy), which is the framework for how \\n executive directors are paid. This Policy was included in the 2020 directors’ remuneration report and can also be found on \\n our website www.networkrail.co.uk.\\n \\n Key agenda items for the year\\n \\n Our annual remuneration report outlines the outcomes for the 2021 financial year in terms of executive remuneration.  \\n The key points to note for 2020/21 outcomes are:\\n •  In the light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally, as a result of \\n the Covid-19 pandemic, Network Rail’s chair, Sir Peter Hendy, and chief executive, Andrew Haines, both took a voluntary \\n reduction in their remuneration of 20% for four months from December 2020 to March 2021.\\n \\n •  A decision on the 2020/21 performance related pay scheme had not been agreed at time of this report. However, in \\n light of the financial pressures mentioned above, the chief executive and chief financial officer declined to accept a \\n performance related payment this year.\\n \\n The rest of this statement explains how executive remuneration is determined at Network Rail and gives more details on the \\n outcomes of this year.\\n \\n Implementation of Policy in 2021\\n \\n All decisions made by the committee during the year were \\n in compliance with the Policy. The Policy is based on four \\n key principles:\\n 1.  Simple: the framework should be transparent and simple \\n \\n the individual. At the same time, we need to ensure value \\n for money for the taxpayer and to reflect our status as a \\n publicly funded body.\\n \\n 3.  Performance and safety: there should be a performance \\n \\n for all stakeholders to understand.\\n \\n 2.  Competitive and fair: attracting and retaining \\n \\n leaders of the necessary ability requires remuneration \\n arrangements that are reasonable in the markets that \\n we compete in for talent, and which fairly reflect the \\n appropriate market rates for the skills and experience of \\n \\n related element of the package which rewards \\n performance in areas that are most important for our \\n stakeholders. There shouldn’t be a reward for failure. \\n The safety of our workforce, passengers and the general \\n public is at the heart of everything we do and must be \\n reflected in the remuneration framework.\\n \\n Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   123\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n 4.  Aligned across Network Rail: where possible, remuneration structures will be aligned across the organisation. All \\n \\n Network Rail employees continue to be eligible for performance related pay, determined using a consistent performance \\n framework across the organisation, although it is not a contractual entitlement.\\n \\n The remuneration framework for executive directors agreed in 2020 is based on these principles and includes the  \\n following elements:\\n \\n Salary\\n \\n Pension\\n \\n Salaries are set at a level which reflects the skills and experience of the individual as well as \\n the scope of the responsibilities of the role.\\n \\n Participation in pension schemes is on the same basis as other managerial positions at \\n Network Rail.\\n \\n Performance related pay\\n \\n Our plan is based on the achievement of stretching annual performance targets, which is \\n aligned to the business scorecard.\\n \\n 2020/21 outcomes for  \\n executive directors \\n \\n Business performance is measured through the scorecards. \\n These evaluate performance against key measures \\n and targets that have been agreed with customers and \\n stakeholders. Since 2019/20, the reference for performance \\n related pay (PRP) was changed to a dashboard with \\n simpler, more outcome-focussed set of measures, that \\n Network Rail’s stakeholders, especially passengers, would \\n see as a success. The measures on the dashboard and the \\n business scorecards are aligned. PRP for senior employees \\n uses the national dashboard outturn and one quarter \\n (25 per cent) of PRP is also determined by an individual’s \\n performance rating. This gives a direct line of sight between \\n the achievement of individual objectives and PRP.\\n \\n Overall National scorecard performance was below target \\n at 40.4 per cent. The PRP dashboard outturn was slightly \\n lower at 37.6 per cent.\\n \\n At the time of publication, as we continue to assess the \\n financial and economic consequences of the Covid-19 \\n pandemic, a decision on the PRP outcome for 2020/21 has \\n not been made. However, the chief executive and the chief \\n financial officer have both declined a PRP payment for the year.\\n \\n Further details of the PRP scheme can be found on page 126.\\n \\n 124   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n National dashboard\\n \\n There is a distinct set of performance measures set \\n specifically for performance related pay, and whilst these \\n are different from the measures on business scorecards, \\n they have been chosen to closely mirror overall business \\n performance. The measures on the dashboard represent \\n the key strategic themes of train service delivery, safety, \\n efficiencies and people.\\n \\n David Noyes,\\n chair, nomination and remuneration committee\\n 15 July 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n ANNUAL \\n REMUNERATION REPORT\\n \\n This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule \\n 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) \\n (Amendment) Regulations 2013.

Jeremy Westlake’s salary is slightly higher in 2020/21 as there was an additional working day in the financial year.\\n \\n 4. In light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Andrew \\n \\n Haines’ took a voluntary reduction in remuneration of 20% for four periods from December 2020 to March 2021.\\n \\n 5.  In the light of the financial pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the executive directors declined to receive a payment under the PRP 2020/21 scheme.\\n Pay Ratios (audited)\\n \\n The Government announced new legislation for employers \\n to publish their pay ratios from 2020. The pay ratio is \\n the gap between the chief executive and the 25th, 50th \\n and 75th percentile of employees - using the single figure \\n disclosed in remuneration reporting in the table above. A \\n historical record will be published incrementally to a 10-\\n year period moving forward.\\n \\n For transparency and good governance, the nomination \\n and remuneration committee decided to publish the pay \\n ratio information a year early in the 2018/19 report and to \\n \\n also publish the information from 2017/18 so that it could \\n be compared. \\n \\n There are three calculation methodologies to choose from:\\n A. Calculate total remuneration for all employees and take \\n the percentiles to calculate the pay ratio against the \\n chief executive single figure total remuneration.\\n \\n B.

Change of chief executive during the year. Pay ratio based on Mark Carne CBE and Andrew Haines OBE’s combined single figure total for 2018/19\\n \\n 3. Andrew Haines OBE’s single figure total was used for 2019/20.\\n \\n When taking the employee data for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, the total remuneration figure has been calculated \\n based on an office worker at these percentiles rather than other employee groups. Using a front-line or operations worker \\n would have reduced the ratio as these types of roles can be eligible for overtime, allowances and shift payments, all of \\n which would have increased the comparator pay and decreased the ratio. The additional payments are not guaranteed and \\n therefore likely to change each year. The total remuneration figure for an office worker at these percentiles is likely to be \\n lower and also less variable year on year. It is therefore considered to be a better comparator.\\n \\n Whilst the pay ratio for the 25th percentile has decreased since last year, this has not been the case for the median and \\n 75th percentile. The employees selected in these percentiles were in management roles who were not given a pay award \\n during 2020/21, which has impacted the pay ratios in comparison to the previous year. \\n \\n Executive director changes\\n \\n There have been no changes this year.\\n \\n Incentive plan 2020/21 – annual performance related pay (audited) \\n \\n During the year, two directors were eligible to participate \\n in this scheme; Jeremy Westlake and Andrew Haines OBE. \\n The maximum potential annual performance related \\n pay award for Jeremy Westlake in 2020/21 was 20 per \\n cent of salary. Andrew Haines OBE’s maximum potential \\n annual performance related pay award was nine per \\n cent. Stretching performance targets were set at the start \\n of the year in the context of the PRP dashboard. The \\n approach for performance related pay is aligned across the \\n business, including executive directors. The PRP dashboard \\n outturn, which is closely related to the business scorecard, \\n determines the percentage pay-out against the maximum \\n award. For 2020/21, one quarter (25 per cent) of PRP \\n was based on an individual’s performance rating, and \\n \\n each rating carried a different percentage weighting. For \\n example, a ‘good’ performance rating will have an 11.25 \\n per cent contribution to the overall PRP.\\n \\n Performance against the national scorecard is summarised \\n on pages 26 to 29. Our National scorecard performance \\n was below target at 40.4 per cent. We benefited from the \\n reduced timetable – we had fewer passengers and ran \\n fewer trains. This resulted in better than planned train \\n performance, and it also allowed us to finish ahead of \\n our budgeted renewals work. Overall performance was \\n impacted by the workforce fatalities we have had this year, \\n coupled with the impact of the Stonehaven derailment. \\n Due to Covid-19, no network wide passenger satisfaction \\n \\n 126   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021\\n \\n \\x0cCorporate governance\\n \\n surveys were undertaken in the year and as a result the \\n passenger satisfaction measure was set at zero per cent.\\n The Performance-Related Pay (PRP) dashboard outturn is \\n slightly lower than our National scorecard at 37.6 per cent. \\n This is partly due to our performance against two index \\n measures not captured in the PRP dashboard; to measure \\n our environmental sustainability and how we handle \\n complaints, offset by the weighting we have given to the \\n financial performance in the PRP dashboard. In addition, \\n each year the safety, health and environment committee \\n \\n (SHEC) considers the overall outturn from a safety \\n perspective and decides whether to recommend any further \\n adjustments to reflect safety performance.\\n \\n Having reviewed the outturns of the safety measures and \\n the overall safety performance, the committee concluded \\n that no further adjustments were required besides setting \\n the Passenger Safety measure to zero (agreed earlier in the \\n year to recognise the impact of the Stonehaven derailment \\n and associated fatalities).\\n \\n Pension (audited) \\n \\n 1.  Executive directors are eligible to participate in one of the Network Rail defined benefit pension schemes or the defined \\n \\n contribution pension scheme on the same basis as other employees.\\n \\n 2.  Under the existing executive pension policy, Jeremy Westlake is entitled to an allowance in lieu of pension on the same \\n \\n basis as other employees of Network Rail, subject to the discretion of the group HR director. This allowance is equivalent \\n to the employer’s pension contributions otherwise payable, minus an adjustment for the cost of providing continued \\n life assurance and the employer National Insurance Contributions payable. Andrew Haines OBE was not eligible to an \\n allowance in lieu of pension as part of his appointment.\\n \\n 3.  Previously, executive directors received an additional pension allowance in the form of a cash supplement based on a \\n \\n percentage of their earnings above the notional earnings cap (£170,400 for 2021/21 tax year and previously £166,200 \\n for 2019/20). This policy no longer applies to new appointments.\\n \\n The table below sets out details for executive directors for 2021 in respect of all Network Rail pension benefits, split between \\n the defined benefit and defined contribution/additional allowance.

Regional responses to the crisis \\n have also been highlighted on pages 36 to 55.\\n \\n The Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail and its plans to reform \\n the rail industry were published after the balance sheet \\n date. This proposes that, commencing in late 2023, a \\n new public body, Great British Railways, will integrate the \\n railways, owning the infrastructure, collecting fare revenue, \\n running, and planning the network, and setting most fares \\n and timetables. It is planned that Network Rail will be \\n absorbed into the public body to bring about single, unified, \\n and accountable leadership for the national network. At this \\n stage it is not likely that this reform will involve the winding \\n up of Network Rail Limited but in any event Great British \\n Railways will assume the existing functions of Network \\n Rail Limited as well as have a wider range of powers and \\n functions. The transformation programme is dependent on \\n further activities including legislation and will take time to \\n fully deliver. \\n \\n The change in corporation tax rates, to 25% from 19% \\n (effective from April 2023), was substantively enacted in \\n the Finance Bill 2021 after the balance sheet date. It is \\n estimated that this will increase the deferred tax provision \\n by £1.0bn and will be reflected in next year’s accounts.\\n \\n Aside from the above, as at the date of signing these \\n financial statements there have not been any significant \\n post balance sheet events, whether adjusting or non-\\n adjusting.\\n \\n Stuart Kelly,\\n Group general counsel and company secretary\\n 15 July 2021\\n \\n \\x0c'"

Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   93  \\x0cCorporate governance  CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE REPORT  At Network Rail, we recognise the value of good corporate governance and believe that it’s  essential to the success of the company and to delivering our strategy for passengers and  stakeholders. Throughout 2020/21, we’ve ensured that our governance arrangements are  appropriate to the range of challenges we’ve faced. We’ve acted on external feedback and  corporate governance reviews to maintain a high standard of governance.  Covid-19 governance  Devolution  In response to the pandemic we activated our Strategic  Crisis Management Team (SCMT). Led by the director  of Network Services, the SCMT includes colleagues from  across the organisation and is responsible for managing the  impact of coronavirus on the railway, our passengers and  our people. The SCMT initially met daily, and then weekly,  to coordinate the continuity of the company’s business and  keep the railway open.   The SCMT has been supported by the National Alert  Coordination Group, which manages the logistical response  to the pandemic within Network Rail. This included  ensuring our workforce had the right personal protective  equipment to continue working safely and coordinating our  testing programme to provide an extra layer of protection  for our people. Command structures within our regions and  directorates also implemented necessary policy changes  and managed day-to-day issues.   With the Rail Delivery Group, we created the Joint Executive  Oversight Team where we worked to coordinate an industry- wide response. And the Rail Industry Coronavirus Forum set  up Emergency Working Principles Agreements that enabled  Network Rail and the trades unions to prioritise activities  and work more quickly.  Our Board, its committees and the executive leadership  team have continued to meet online to ensure we meet the  needs of the railway. See page 15 for more on our response  to the pandemic.  In 2019 we started our Putting Passengers First journey with a  reorganisation. We devolved accountabilities and established  platforms for us to deliver value for money to those we serve.  We’ve made good progress, with new ways of working already  reaping rewards for our customers and passengers.  Because of the added challenges caused by the pandemic,  we’ve re organised ourselves to strengthen devolution  and be more agile and efficient. To give us fewer network- wide functions at executive level, we’ve transferred the  responsibilities of both Network Services and the Group  Transformation team into other existing network-wide  functions.  Network Services provided services to our routes and regions,  as well as network-wide operational oversight. We’ve put  Network Services’ route/region services together with Route  Services so there’s one place for interaction with internal  customers, routes and regions. And to support better  oversight and decision making across the full performance  cycle of the railway, we’ve moved Network Services’ activities  that help the rail network operate effectively as a system  into System Operator. We believe this will provide the best  operational service for our customers and passengers.  There were previously teams leading on transformation at  a network-wide level in Group Transformation and within  Network Services. We’ve now transferred these teams to  Group HR.  For more information on our Putting Passengers First  programmee se page 20.  94   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cRail Reform  On 20 May 2021 the Government published “Great British  Railways: Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail – White Paper”.  It shows how the Government “will make railways the  backbone of a cleaner, more environmentally friendly and  modern public transport system across the country.  “By replacing franchising, accelerating innovation and  integrating the railways, Great British Railway will deliver an  efficient, financially sustainable railway that meets the needs  of passengers and those who rely on rail on a daily basis.”  The Board fully supports the Williams-Shapps Plan for  Rail and will work closely with industry partners and key  stakeholders to deliver its objectives.  Engaging with our stakeholders  At Network Rail we consider our stakeholders to be at the  heart of our strategy. The interests of key stakeholders  and the matters set out in section 172 of the Companies  Act 2006 (i.e. promoting success of the company)  (see pages 24 to 25) have been considered in Board  discussions and decision making.   The Putting Passengers First programme was built on an  extensive listening exercise. We listened to a wide variety  of stakeholders to help us understand what the company  does well and where it needs to improve. We engaged with  more than 300 colleagues at all levels, across the country,  including frontline and office based, as well as external  partners and organisations. The outcomes informed our  Putting Passengers First programme.  Railway supervisory boards comprising Network Rail, train  operating companies, Transport Focus, and other key  stakeholders provide forums for discussions to identify  opportunities to improve the experience of all passengers  and freight users. The aim of these boards is to bring  track and train closer together. Meetings were held in the  Western route, Wales route, Anglia route, West Coast Main  Line, and Chilterns; the System Operator Advisory Board  provides a similar function.  Engaging with our workforce  We recognise that employees who feel actively engaged with  the company, its purpose, vision and strategy and who feel   Corporate governance  listened to, are more likely to feel that their work is meaningful  and will make a difference for users of the railway.  Since its development, the Network Rail Story (see page  8) has been the foundation of our workforce engagement.  We’ve a wide range of initiatives through which we engage  with our people, including: •  Putting Passengers First programme; •  systems thinking interventions; •  listening programmes; •  business briefings; •  employee networks; •  reverse mentoring •  Trade Union engagement; and •  employee newsletters (The Network and Front Line Focus).  As well as this, we use regular employee engagement  surveys to understand what our people are thinking and  feeling at a given time. The surveys show whether there has  been an improvement compared with previous years, and if  further action is needed. There are three surveys each year.  In 2021 there will be a full Your Voice survey, and two Your  Voice pulse surveys focussing on progress and direction.  Our Board is briefed on the outcome of the surveys and  considers any actions required. Our routes and functions  also run additional, locally focussed surveys if needed.   See How we engage with our stakeholders on pages 24 and  25 for more information on how and why we engage with   our workforce.  The Network Rail Board  During 2020/21, the Board focussed much of its time on: •  our six strategic priorities (see page 21) •  the industry response to the pandemic •  the environmental sustainability strategy •  workforce safety  During 2021/22, it’s anticipated that the Board’s focus will  be on: •  workforce safety/Safety Task Force •  earthworks/weather resilience/environmental   sustainability strategy  •  industry recovery from the pandemic and the return of   passengers  •  Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail •  updated freight strategy”  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   95  \\x0cCorporate governance  Compliance with the UK corporate governance code  The Board believes that in 2020/21 the company  fulfilled the principles and provisions of the UK Corporate  Governance Code 2018, except for the following provisions  that it’s unable to comply with, mainly due to our status as  an arm’s length body of the Government: •  provision 5: relating to the prescribed methods of  engagement with employees. The three options  suggested by the code were considered by the Board.  However, each was discounted as an appropriate method  for Network Rail because our workforce engagement  activities already go beyond the requirements of the  code;   •  provision 9: in respect of appointment of the chair. The  Secretary of State appoints the chair in accordance with  the Governance Code on Public Appointments;  •  provision 25 and 26: in respect of the appointment, re-  appointment and removal of the external auditor. Under  the terms of the Framework Agreement between the  company and the Department for Transport (DfT), the   Comptroller and Auditor General assisted by the National  Audit Office acts as Network Rail’s external independent  auditor; and  •  provision 34: in respect of the remuneration for the   chair. Under the terms of the Framework Agreement, the  remuneration of the chair is agreed by the Secretary of  State.  The Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council’s  website: https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate- governance-and-stewardship/uk-corporate-governance- code   The Board believes that the company complied with the  Corporate Governance in Central Government Departments:  Code of Good Practice. The code can be found on the  Government’s website: https://www.gov.uk/government/ publications/corporate-governance-code-for-central- government-departments-2017  Board leadership and company purpose  Network Rail owns, operates and develops Britain’s railway infrastructure. We operate within regulatory and control  frameworks and are an arm’s length government body. Our financial management and corporate governance ways of  working with the DfT are described in the Framework Agreement. A copy of the agreement is available on our website   www.networkrail.co.uk.  The Board ensures there is effective engagement with stakeholders and encourages participation from them. Michael  Harrison, director of UK Investments at UKGI, was appointed as the company’s special director in May 2020. On behalf of  the Secretary of State, Michael is responsible for communicating the views of the Secretary of State and the DfT’s wider  strategic, statutory and fiduciary interests to the Board, while acting in accordance with his duties as a non-executive  director.  Network Rail is regulated by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) under its Network Licence for our management of the  rail infrastructure. The ORR fixes the income Network Rail receives from the Government and the outputs it must deliver  during each five-year control period. Our Board is accountable to the Secretary of State for Transport for the leadership and  management of the business.

It meets  regularly to consider strategic and operational matters.   The team includes the chief executive, chief financial  officer, five regional managing directors and five other  senior executives.  Board composition and division of  responsibilities  At the date of this report, the Board consisted of one  non-executive chair, two executive directors and nine non- executive directors.  Photographs and biographies of the Board of directors,  including details of their skills and experience can be found  on pages 90 to 93.  Chair – Sir Peter Hendy CBE The chair is responsible for leading the Board, its effective  functioning and promoting the highest standards of  corporate governance, he encourages all directors to  actively contribute to Board meetings and promotes  constructive relations between the executive and non- executive directors. The chair represents Network Rail  and works with the chief executive to develop strategic  relationships with the non-executive directors, the  customers of Network Rail, DfT, HM Treasury, Parliament,  the Cabinet Office, Transport Scotland, Welsh Assembly  Government and other stakeholders. The chair reviews the  performance of the non-executive directors.  Senior independent director (SID) – Rob Brighouse The SID acts as a sounding Board for the chair and serves  as an intermediary for the other directors when necessary.  The SID is responsible for the chair’s performance  review. He is available to the Secretary of State if they  have concerns or where contact through the chair is  inappropriate or has failed to resolve an issue.   The special director – Michael Harrison The special director is appointed by the Secretary of State.  They are responsible for communicating the views of the  Secretary of State and the DfT’s wider strategic statutory  and fiduciary interests to the Board, while acting in  accordance with their duties as a non-executive director.  Corporate governance  Chief executive – Andrew Haines OBE The chief executive is responsible for setting the strategic  direction of the company and for the company’s  performance. He keeps the Board informed and brings  to its attention all matters that significantly affect, or  are capable of significantly affecting, the achievements  of Network Rail. The chief executive provides clear and  visible leadership in business conduct and promotes the  requirement that all executive leadership team members  and employees demonstrate the company’s values. He is  accountable to the Board for all elements of Network Rail’s  business, and specifically for safety performance. He is also  the accounting officer.  The chief executive is personally accountable to  Parliament for safeguarding the public funds available  to Network Rail; for ensuring appropriateness, value for  money and feasibility in the handling of those public  funds; for the day-to-day operations and management  of Network Rail and for signing the accounts, the annual  report and the governance statement. He is required to  ensure that Network Rail is run following the principles,  rules, guidance and advice set out in Managing Public  Money, which can be found on the Government’s  website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ managing-public-money.   As the accounting officer, he is supported by the Board for  the responsibilities set out in Managing Public Money, and  for the proper conduct of business and maintenance of  ethical standards. The internal audit function also supports  the accounting officer. The director of risk and assurance  provided his audit opinion to both the accounting officer  and the audit and risk committee. The opinion considered  the overall adequacy and effectiveness of Network Rail’s  framework of governance, risk management and control.  For further details on the internal audit function and on the  audit and risk committee, see pages 111 to 116.  Chief financial officer – Jeremy Westlake The chief financial officer is responsible for leading Network  Rail’s finance function which includes the teams working  on matters related to (i) planning, finance and efficiencies,  (ii) financing, funding and commercial matters, and (iii)  governance, risk, assurance and improvement (GRAI).  In June 2020 a new Rail Investment Centre of Excellence  was established in the finance function, when the former  Infrastructure Projects function was devolved to regions  and functions.

Sharon Flood resigned from the Board on  23 August 2020, after serving for six years. Mark Bayley  CBE and Fiona Ross were appointed as non-executive  directors on 11 May 2020. Ismail Amla and Stephen  Duckworth were appointed as non-executive directors on 1  April 2021.  The non-executive directors provide independence,  external skills and challenge to the Board through broad  business and commercial experience from the rail and  other industries. They provide assurance that the executive  directors are exercising good judgement in the delivery of  strategy and decision making.  The Board reviews the independence of its non-executive  directors annually as part of its Board effectiveness process.  It has considered if there are any circumstances which are  likely to impair or could appear to impair the independence  of a non-executive director.  When considering the appointment of new directors,  the Board takes into account the other demands on the  proposed director’s time. The Board asks that significant  commitments and an indication of the time commitment  are disclosed to the Board prior to appointment.  The Board notes that the corporate governance code  includes guidelines on the meaning of ‘independence’,  and it is appropriate to disclose that Rob Brighouse and  Mark Bayley are beneficiaries of the Railway Pension  Scheme (RPS). Over 150 companies from the rail  industry participate in the RPS and the scheme is run by  independent trust managers. Given this structure, the Board  considers that both directors are independent, as Network  Rail is only one of the contributing companies to RPS.  The links to the statements of responsibility for the chair,  chief executive, senior independent director and the  non-executive directors can be found on the Network Rail  website www.networkrail.co.uk.  Group general counsel and company secretary –   Stuart Kelly  The group general counsel and company secretary provides  advice and support to the Board, the chair and the directors  on legal and governance matters. He ensures that a high  standard of governance is maintained so that the Board   100   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  functions effectively and efficiently. The appointment and  removal of the company secretary is a matter for the Board  as a whole.  Directors’ attendance at meetings  The Board met nine times during 2020/21 and has also  held two strategy meetings.  Directors’ attendance at Board meetings for the year  ending 31 March 2021, is shown in the table below. Non- executive directors are also required to attend various  committee meetings and their attendance is shown in the  respective committee reports on pages 104 to 133.  During 2020/21, there were a number of changes to  membership of the Board.   Sharon Flood resigned on 23 August 2020, having served  on the Board for six years. Mark Bayley, Michael Harrison  and Fiona Ross were all appointed on 11 May 2020. Ismail  Amla and Stephen Duckworth were appointed as non- executive directors on 1 April 2021, and therefore did not  attend any meetings in 2020/21.

Strategy 36%  Operations 44%  Finance 6%  Governance 14%  Composition, succession and  evaluation  Board recruitment and induction Details of the appointment process for the directors  appointed during the year can be found in the nomination  and remuneration committee report on pages 119 to 121.  A comprehensive induction programme is in place for newly  appointed directors, which is tailored to each director in  consideration of their background knowledge, skills and  experience. New directors are provided with key corporate,  strategic and financial documents to familiarise them with  the company’s business. The induction programme includes  individual meetings with Board members, the group general  counsel and company secretary, senior executives and other  key stakeholders.   Succession Planning The Board and the nomination and remuneration committee  considers whether the appointment process and the approach  to succession planning supports a diverse and sustainable  pipeline of talent for senior roles within the business.  The Board recognises that effective talent management  programmes are necessary to improve diversity within all  levels of the company and are essential for the delivery of the  company’s long-term strategy and objectives.  Board and executive diversity The Board is aware that diversity extends beyond gender,  and includes amongst other things age, social, ethnic,  educational and professional backgrounds. Further details  about Network Rail’s organisational diversity and inclusion  policies and how these have been implemented in the year  can be found in the Our people section, page 67.  We know that to truly put passengers first, empower our  people and make them proud to work here, our senior  leadership needs to be reflective of our passengers, our  people and the communities we serve. That’s why the Board  approved Network Rail’s first Board diversity and inclusion  policy in February 2021. The policy notes the company’s  long-term ambitions in relation to board diversity and  specific objectives to progress towards them. These include  that, by the end of the 2021/22 financial year, at least one  third of the Board will be female and one of the directors  will be from a BAME background.  The policy is supplementary to the organisational equality,  diversity and inclusion policy and the Everyone Matters  diversity strategy, and implements their aspirations in the  context of our senior leaders. The full policy can be found  on the Network Rail website www.networkrail.co.uk.   The Board is comprised of ten non-executive directors and  two executive directors. These individuals come from a   Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   101  \\x0cCorporate governance  variety of backgrounds and experience. The Board is 83 per cent male and 17 per cent female, however, when considering  non-executive directors only, the split is 80 per cent male and 20 per cent female.  The following chart shows the length of service of the non-executive directors.  0-2 Years: 5 NEDs  3-4 years: 2 NEDs  5-6 years: 3 NEDs  7-9 years: 0 NEDs  Board effectiveness  The Board is committed to maintaining the highest  standards of corporate governance. In line with best practice,  Manchester Square Partners (MSP) undertook a review of the  effectiveness of the Network Rail Board in early 2021.  The process involved one-to-one interviews with Board  members and the group general counsel and company  secretary. Executive leadership team members,   colleagues at the DfT, ORR and Transport Scotland were  also interviewed.  and more strategic matters was appropriate. It was  acknowledged that some of the technical, operational  matters had a strategic element to them;   2. given the Board’s complex and busy agenda, careful   attention should be paid to the resilience and capacity  of individuals to effectively manage a substantial volume  of work. In this context it was important that succession  plans for senior and business critical roles were regularly  reviewed for both planned and unplanned situations; and  3. the importance of giving the Board sufficient time for  reflection and discussion that was not driven by an  agenda or the need to make decisions.   MSP reviewed Board and committee meeting papers and  observed the March 2021 Board meeting. A report on the  review, including recommendations, was provided to the  Board in July 2021.  An action plan was being developed to address these  findings. The action plan, and progress against delivering  it, would be agreed/monitored by the nomination and  remuneration committee.  The key findings of MSP’s board effectiveness review are set  out below.  The key finding from the review was that the Board was “an  exceptionally busy and demanding one with a challenging  and content rich agenda … overall performance is  deemed strong”. Manchester Square Partners’ primary  recommendations to make the Board even more effective  included: 1. the Board should consider whether the balance between   technical, operational matters coming to the Board   Professional development, training  and support for directors  Board members are offered a range of training and  development opportunities each year to support their  continuing professional development. Directors often  receive corporate governance and legal updates, as  appropriate.  102   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  Regional managing directors and function heads regularly attend Board meetings to provide updates on the key issues  affecting their areas of the business.  The directors have access to the advice and services of the group general counsel and company secretary, who is responsible  for compliance with Board procedures and the provision of information to the Board in a timely manner. The directors have  the right to seek independent professional advice at reasonable expense to Network Rail.  In November 2020 the Board was briefed on the periodic review (PR) process, ahead of PR23. Periodic reviews are one  of the principal mechanisms by which the ORR holds Network Rail to account and secures value for money for users and  funders of the railway. PR23 will determine what Network Rail should deliver in our role of operating, maintaining and  renewing the network in Control Period 7, which will run from April 2024 – March 2029. The briefing considered Network  Rail’s regulatory environment and the Board’s role in the PR process.  Election and re-election of directors  Each of the directors is subject to (re-) election at the 2021  AGM. The Board considers that all directors act in good  faith, for the long-term benefit and success of Network Rail,  and continue to perform effectively.  Directors’ and officers’ (D&O) liability  insurance  Network Rail maintains D&O liability insurance. Network  Rail did not indemnify any directors during 2020/21.  Directors’ conflict of interest  The Annual General Meeting (AGM)  The Board identifies and manages potential conflicts of  interests that directors may have. Each Board meeting  begins with disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. At  the date of this report, the following key potential conflicts  of interest have been declared: •  Michael Harrison is director of UK Investments at UKGI; •  Mike Putnam is a member of Arcadis NV’s supervisory   board;  •  Fiona Ross is a non-executive director at The Scottish   Government; and  •  Neil Sachdev, non-executive director of Network Rail’s   Property Supervisory Committee, is chair of the East West  Rail Company Limited.  The formal business of the AGM is set out in a number  of separate resolutions to be considered at the meeting.  The company’s sole member, the Secretary of State  for Transport, is provided with a copy of the notice of  meeting, alongside the annual report and accounts (as is  the National Audit Office). The Secretary of State can vote  either for or against a resolution or can withhold his vote  (although the law does not class a withheld vote to be a  vote). Final voting figures are announced to the London  Stock Exchange.

Running a safe railway will always be  our priority. We want everyone to feel safe whether they’re  working on, living near, or travelling on the railway. We’ve  worked tirelessly to keep our passengers and workforce safe  during the Covid-19 pandemic, while operating a railway to  help key workers, transport much needed freight goods, and  keep the rest of the country running.  The pandemic had a major impact on our safety  performance this year. And we have been strengthening  how we support mental health and wellbeing. At the end of  2020/21, 20 per cent of line managers had been trained.  This is a 10 per cent increase on 2019/20. Because we’ve  been socially distancing colleagues we’ve had more vehicles  on the road; life-saving rules breaches rose and were mostly  related to employees speeding in road vehicles.   Tragically, three people lost their lives on the 12 August  2020 when a train derailed at Carmont, near Stonehaven.  Brett McCullough was driving the train, Donald Dinnie was  a conductor, and Christopher Stuchbury was a passenger.  In response, Network Rail set up two new external task  forces, one aimed at its response to severe weather events,  and the other aimed at management of earthworks and  drainage along the railway.  The number of suicides and trespass incidents that took  place on the railway was slightly below that of the previous  year. Our partnership with Learn Live has educated over ten  million children and young people in schools and colleges  nationally, on the dangers associated with railway trespass;  this has coincided with an encouraging reduction in reported  child trespass. The remit for this relationship has now been  extended to include level crossing and station safety.  Sadly, there were also three workforce fatalities in the year.  On 8 April 2020 Aden Ashurst, working for AmcoGiffen,  was struck by a train at Roade. On 30 November 2020,  Kevin Mauger was fatality injured at the Long-Welded Rail  Facility in Eastleigh. On 9 February 2021, Tyler Byrne was  struck by a train at Surbiton. Investigations are underway  to determine the causes and to prevent similar events from  ever happening again.   The trackworker Safety Task Force has continued its  work to improve our people’s safety when working on  our tracks through better task planning, increased use of  safety equipment, and through the eradication of lookout  working. The task force has completed 2,913 out of 6,463  key objectives that are to be delivered by 31 July 2022;  and we’ve seen the use of unassisted lookouts decrease by  over 75 per cent since July 2019. Near misses involving our  workforce have also decreased by half during 2020/21.  104   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  The committee reviewed the safety performance data  that makes up part of the performance related pay award  for senior executives and made a recommendation to the  remuneration committee (see page 126).

Stephen  Duckworth, non-executive director, has a standing invitation  to attend meetings. Other executives and external visitors  are also invited from time to time to report on specific areas  that lie within the committee’s areas of responsibility.   The general secretary of the National Union of Rail,  Maritime and Transport Workers (the RMT) is invited to  attend all meetings. This adds scrutiny and challenge  to the committee’s business and is consistent with our  commitment to remain transparent to the wider rail  industry and its important stakeholders.   Ian Prosser CBE, chief inspector of railways and director of  railway safety at the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), attends  two meetings each year to present the regulator’s view on  our safety performance.   Role and responsibilities of the  committee  The environmental aspect of the committee’s role has  been redefined since the creation of the environmental  sustainability committee in 2020. The SHEC committee  now oversees environmental legal and regulatory  compliance while the environmental sustainability  committee has broader responsibility for environmental  strategy and related matters.   The committee’s role is to monitor how the company  implements its responsibilities on safety and health through  its everyday business activities, and how it complies with  its environmental obligations. The committee needs to be   satisfied that the company’s relevant strategies, policies  and procedures are effective, reviewed and adapted as  necessary to evolving business activities.  What the committee does:  •  it reviews the group’s strategies, systems, policies   and practices for SHEC. It also makes sure that the  governance and management structures support these  being implemented effectively   •  it considers the significant risks to individuals and the   company’s strategies for SHEC and whether the executive  is managing them effectively   •  it reviews internal audits, within its SHEC remit, that are  carried out across the company on the effectiveness of  strategies, systems, policies and practices. It makes sure  that the audits have the correct scope and it follows up to  confirm that any recommendations have been properly  addressed and implemented  •  it considers findings from internal and external   investigations and how the executive has responded to  them  •  it makes recommendations to the nomination and  remuneration committee on the company’s SHEC  performance to inform decisions about performance  related pay.   After each meeting, the chair reports to the next Network  Rail Board meeting.  Principal activities during the year  In 2020/21 the committee discussed: •  quarterly SHEC reports from the group Technical   Authority. These included scorecard data, information  on workforce safety, workforce and contractor accidents,  train accident risks, level crossings, health and wellbeing,  public safety, and contractor performance  •  quarterly updates on safety risks and internal audits on   SHEC matters   Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   105  \\x0cCorporate governance  •  scrutiny of SHEC-related incidents including those at Carmont, Eastleigh, Surbiton, Margam, and Llangennech and what  lessons could be learned and applied, and monitoring our business follow up to any SHEC related recommendations from  the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB)   •  the SHEC performance of our regions and functions, particularly focussing on how safety and health and wellbeing were   being incorporated and devolved within Network Rail’s Putting Passengers First programme  •  quarterly updates on SHEC matters relating to the Covid-19 pandemic including keeping our workforce and the public   safe and well   •  safety, health and wellbeing strategies including the safety of the public on and around the railway network including on  trains, at level crossings and in stations; track worker safety and the actions we’re taking to reduce the number of near  misses on and near railway tracks  •  Lord Robert Mair’s review of earthworks following the tragic accident at Carmont, Aberdeenshire on 12 August 2020 •  Our business-wide programmes to improve safety culture in the workplace including the Safety Task Force which was set  up following the tragic events at Margam in July 2019, and the safety culture programme conducted by JMJ consultants.  Internal audit Internal audit plays a key role in providing independent assurance in managing safety, health and environmental  compliance risks. At each meeting the director of risk and internal audit updated the committee on any changes to the  SHEC audit plan, notable audits, overdue actions, themes and key issues arising from Internal Audit’s work.  Audits included our management of manual handling and spoken safety critical communications, and activities are now  underway to address the risks. This includes updating both organisation wide standards and policies as well as route  operational controls. Internal Audit has reviewed the progress of the safety task force, providing confidence that it is  appropriately set-up to deliver, and will continue to provide independent assurance during 2021.  Annual site visit, July 2020 The committee makes an annual visit to locations around the country to see first-hand the SHEC issues they discuss at  meetings. In 2020 the committee visited Reading Station to review the recent developments at the station itself, Reading  Depot, and the new technology and equipment that the Safety Task Force was trialling to keep track workers safe from the  risk of moving trains.  Planned activities for 2021/22   •  Workforce safety and wellbeing including ongoing monitoring of progress made by the Safety Task Force and safety   culture programmes.   •  Public and workforce safety including an ongoing review of fire inspection compliance and procedures across the business. •  A review of signals passed at danger incidents (SPADs) and reviewing potential technical solutions. •  Environmental compliance and ongoing monitoring of how Network Rail is ensuring compliance with environmental   legislation, regulation and best practice.   •  Governance: monitoring SHEC issues and how they are being effectively addressed within Network Rail’s evolving business   structure.   106   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  ENVIRONMENTAL  SUSTAINABILITY  COMMITTEE REPORT  I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the  key activities undertaken during 2020/21 alongside its  anticipated activities for 2021/22.  An environmental sustainability advisory committee  had been originally created in October 2019 to provide  support and advice to the executive in the development  of Network Rail’s environmental sustainability strategy  which was approved by the Board in July 2020. The original  committee, chaired by Sharon Flood, had been instrumental  in developing and endorsing an overarching environmental  sustainability strategy and ambitious vision to meet the  expectations of all of Network Rail’s stakeholders including  passengers and freight users, staff and the wider public.  Following publication of the strategy in September 2020,  the Board established this committee to provide support  and oversight into its implementation of the strategy.

Principal activities during the year  The first half of 2020/21 was dedicated to the  development and launch of the sustainability strategy.  From September, the committee was involved in making  sure that Network Rail: •  had a sound plan of action to deliver this ambitious   strategy with an appropriate resourcing plan  In September 2020, Network Rail also published its traction  decarbonisation network strategy (TDNS) interim business  case which sets out the different ways that Network Rail  could contribute to the reduction of direct carbon emissions  from trains.   •  had the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to  measure the targets that have been set and that  activities that would enable achievement of the goals are  recorded  •  had effective supply chain strategies to deliver the   In October 2020, Network Rail continued to demonstrate  its commitment through the publication of the science- based carbon reduction targets making it the first railway  in the world to set targets that would help limit global  warming to 1.5 degrees.   strategy’s objectives  •  had effective sharing of the lessons learnt across both  Network Rail and the rest of industry to identify and  implement best practice  •  worked with external partners and bodies to develop a   whole-of-industry approach to sustainability  •  had a robust communications and engagement plan to   support implementation.  The biodiversity action plan was published setting  out how biodiversity targets would be achieved, and a  training programme launched to support people in better  biodiversity management across the Network Rail estate.   In December, the committee approved the proposal to be  the 35th signatory of the International Union of Railways  Climate declaration.  Planned activities for 2021/22  The next twelve months will see the committee continue to build momentum with delivery of the environmental  sustainability strategy milestones. The regions will continue to develop their own local plans to align with the corporate  strategy and reflect the specific challenges and opportunities relevant to their geographical areas.  The 2021 committee workplan will involve oversight and review of resourcing to deliver the ambitious plan, and roll out of  technology to deliver a cleaner and greener railway. It will also monitor the roll out of electric charging points for electric  vehicles; the plan for the next stages of electrification; development of the Social Value Strategy; baselining for whole-life  carbon in assets; minimising waste and recycling; and joint plans with supply chain partners targeted at carbon emissions  reductions. Network Rail will be supporting the Government as it hosts the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the  Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in June 2021.  108   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  PROPERTY SUPERVISORY  COMMITTEE REPORT  The property supervisory board became a committee of  the Network Rail Board in 2020.  I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the  key activities undertaken during 2020/21, alongside its  anticipated activities for 2021/22.  Firstly, I’d like to welcome Mark Bayley CBE to the  committee. Mark has spent much of his career in the rail  sector. He has particular experience in major projects,  restructurings and corporate finance.   The past year has been incredibly challenging for our  retailers, tenants and commercial partners. We have  been determined to show them support, care and  empathy during the pandemic, while they’ve continued  when possible to provide vital goods and services for  our passengers, particularly those critical workers who  have kept the country moving during the pandemic. In  March 2020, we introduced swift and significant financial  measures to support retailers in our managed stations  and tenants in our commercial estate. These measures  have continued throughout 2020/21 and the committee  has helped to shape and refine them. We’ve also engaged  with the wider rail sector and Government to ensure our  financial measures are commensurate and fair. And we’ve  championed collective approaches and shared lessons  learned during an unprecedented crisis for the sector.   We’ve focussed on devolving Property from a national  function to a regional model, as part of our wider programme  to put passengers first. This key milestone was achieved in  September, with five regional property teams established,  each led by a regional property director. They are now  supported by a smaller group property team, led by our  group property director. Group Property provides services and  activities to the regions, as well as delivering some activities  centrally for reasons of value add, economic and consistency.   Embedding property expertise within each region will  better align the teams to regional objectives and develop  strategies that put passengers first. They’ll do this by   optimising the use of operational land, generating capital  receipts to reinvest in the railway, releasing land for new  homes, and improving conditions and access for our  frontline staff.  The committee has continued to monitor Network Rail’s  overall property performance against its strategy for Control  Period 6 (CP6). This has ensured property colleagues across  the company continued to focus on supporting the regions  to deliver activities, put passengers first, develop sites  through partnerships, and deliver land for housing. They’ve  also been working with partners to deliver positive railway  and community outcomes, and providing great places for  businesses and communities to thrive.

The chief financial officer, group property  director, managing director Southern region, and the general counsel for property normally attend meetings by invitation  as well as representatives from the Department for Transport, Treasury and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority. Group  and regional property directors also attend meetings by invitation.   Role and responsibilities of the committee  The committee’s role is to consider and provide advice upon: •  the long-term vision and strategies for Network Rail property •  regional property related strategies and the management of them, including reviewing the respective regional property   directors’ business plans •  key risks and opportunities •  the performance of the regional property directors and group property team •  subject to the delegated authority to the committee, make decisions or make recommendations •  consider any other matter specifically referred to the committee by the Board or the executive leadership team.  Principal activities during the year  At each meeting the committee receives detailed property updates for discussion. The group property director provides a  written summary of the committee’s activities, the main discussion points, findings, and any recommendations to the Board  for its next meeting.  Until March 2020 the committee had a programme of site visits in the five regions to tie in with their committee meetings.  Due to Covid-19 these visits have been deferred and will be reinstated when it is safe to do so.  Other areas of focus during the year have included:  London & Continental Railway (LCR) In early 2019 we established a formal collaboration with LCR to explore the potential to redevelop land at and around  stations, to deliver land for residential and commercial development, and to generate passenger benefits and money to be  reinvested in the operational railway. Updates on the collaboration are given and reviewed at each committee meeting. The  chair of LCR attended the September 2020 meeting.  Redevelopment of Euston Station The committee has reviewed and provided feedback on the key developments underway at Euston station.  Regional Property directors’ reports Following the Putting Passengers First organisational changes, all regional property directors have presented to the  committee giving them an overview of regional property strategies, targets and efficiencies.  Planned activities for 2021/22  In the year ahead, the committee will continue to monitor progress on: •  devolution and the regional property model •  workplace optimisation and the use of our office estate •  Covid-19 recovery, particularly retail remobilisation •  collaboration with LCR and delivering land for housing  110   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  AUDIT AND RISK  COMMITTEE REPORT  I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the  key activities undertaken during 2020/21, alongside its  anticipated activities for 2021/22. This is my first report as  chair of the committee and I would like to thank my fellow  committee members for their contributions, insight and  support in this period. I also welcome Michael Harrison,  who joined the committee in September 2020.  During 2020/21, the committee continued to focus on the  audit, assurance and risk management processes within the  business in addition to its oversight of financial and other  regulatory requirements. The committee’s work focussed  on the risks facing the business, to understand better the  nature of the risks and provide assurance to the Board on  the effectiveness of the associated internal controls.  Mark Bayley CBE, chair, audit and risk committee 15 July 2021  The committee met four times during 2020/21. Members collectively have a broad range of finance, commercial, aviation/ transport and rail sector expertise that enables them to provide effective oversight of financial, operational and risk matters  and to advise the Board accordingly. All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors, and the chair  has recent and relevant financial experience.

Representatives from the National Audit Office   (NAO) also attend each meeting. At each meeting, time  is set aside for the representatives from the NAO and the  director of risk and internal audit to meet with committee  members without executive management present.  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   111  \\x0cCorporate governance  Role and responsibilities of the  committee  The committee monitors the integrity of the financial  reporting and the audit process and Network Rail’s system  of internal control. The committee also oversees risk  management, regulatory reporting and compliance. It  makes recommendations to the Board on the level of risk  appetite acceptable to the company.  Following each meeting, the chair provides a summary  of the committee’s activities, main discussion points and  findings to the next Board meeting along with a written  report provided by the committee secretary, and makes  recommendations as appropriate.  Principal activities during the year  The committee had presentations from four regional  managing directors on the key risks affecting their business  plans. There were also updates on the Putting Passengers  First programme, cyber security, the competence  management system, business contingency planning in   response to the Covid-19 pandemic, timetabling risks, and  weather and climate change resilience.  At each meeting the committee receives business updates  from group finance, internal audit, group risk and the  independent external auditor. In addition to regular updates,  the committee considers the emerging and principal risks  facing the business and elevates these to the Board where  necessary. The committee conducts an annual evaluation of  its effectiveness, details of which are provided below.  Fair, balanced and understandable  Following a review, the audit and risk committee confirmed  that the annual report and financial statements for  2020/21 present a fair, balanced and understandable  overview and provides the information necessary to assess  the company’s position, performance, business model and  strategy. The committee therefore proposed the document  for approval to the Board.  Significant accounting judgements, key assumptions and estimates  With the support of the NAO, the committee assessed whether suitable accounting policies had been adopted, whether  management had made appropriate estimates and judgements, and disclosures were balanced and fair. The main areas of  focus during the year are set out below.  Accounting judgments  How the committee addressed those judgements  Valuation of rail network  and compliance with  regulatory requirements  The revaluation model used to measure the value of the rail network consists of a number of  estimates and judgements made both by the company and by the Office of Rail and Road  (for example anticipated financial and operational outperformance in the Control Period  (CP6). The committee reviewed reports from management on the key estimates and the  methodology applied to the revaluation model.  The committee also reviewed the work of management and findings of the external  auditors in respect of the reasonableness of key judgements and estimates in respect of the  forecast for CP6, and the impact of the recent White Paper; and the appropriateness of the  associated disclosures in the financial statements.  After this review, the committee confirmed the valuation derived from the estimates, key  judgments and valuation methodology.  112   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  Capital accruals  The estimate of cost of work done is a key judgement in Network Rail’s accounts.  Risk of management  override of internal  controls  Deferred tax  It was considered  whether it was still  appropriate for Network  Rail not to recognise  a deferred tax asset in  relation to its brought  forward tax losses.  Valuation of investment  properties  Pension assumptions  The additions to property, plant and equipment are valued at an estimate of the cost of  work done (COWD) in the year to 31 March 2021. To the extent that the COWD is greater  than the invoiced amount, fixed asset accruals are recognised based on expected amounts  required to settle contractual obligations.  To value the COWD on capital projects appropriately, commercial managers with the  appropriate level of experience assess the progress to completion of the project at the ex- pected cost. Both progress and expected costs have elements that are estimates and require  accounting judgement.  Reports on management’s approach to measuring cost of work done were reviewed along- side details of internal validation and the external auditor’s report on sample testing.   The independent auditor has focussed attention on this area and provided satisfactory  reporting to the committe.  The committee agreed not to recognise a deferred tax asset until it was satisfied when it  could be exchanged for economic benefits. With the high levels of investment expected for  the foreseeable future, the committee saw little prospect that taxable profits would exceed  capital allowances, therefore requiring use of tax assets (including losses brought forward) to  reduce tax liabilities.  Investment properties are stated at fair value. The valuations are based on assumptions and  estimates that require judgement. The committee agreed the appropriate methodology had  been used. The methodology was consistent with prior years and included valuations and  additional assistance from external valuation specialists. The valuations were reviewed by  management and the external valuation specialists.  The group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes. Valuation  of the defined benefit schemes is dependent on certain key assumptions and complex ac- tuarial calculations. External actuaries are therefore engaged to assist in advising on key  assumptions and determining the value of the pension obligations.  The committee noted the conclusion of the triennial valuation in the year. The committee  discussed the key assumptions, including the degree to which these were supported by pro- fessional advice from the actuaries. The independent auditor also focussed attention on this  area and provided reporting to the committee on this matter.  Finally, the committee considered the valuation of the scheme assets, noting the estimation  uncertainty associated with Level 3 assets such as private equity holdings. This included a  consideration of the work of management and the auditor to take account of movements to  the year end, and the focussed work of the auditor in respect of higher risk assets.  The committee is required to review any correspondence received from regulators in respect of financial reporting. There  has been no correspondence from the FRC or the ORR in relation to Network Rail’s financial reporting during the 2020/21  financial year.  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   113  \\x0cCorporate governance  Committee Effectiveness  The committee completed a self-evaluation effectiveness  review, supported by more detailed interviews with  committee members and key attendees. The review has  shown that the committee was functioning effectively,  and no significant areas of concern were raised. The  recommendations are being taken forward to improve the  work of the committee.  In addition, as part of the Board effectiveness evaluation  undertaken in early 2021, feedback was provided on the  effectiveness of the committee. No areas of concern related  to the committee were raised during this review.  The approach taken to the  appointment of the external auditor  The Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG), supported  by the NAO, was appointed as Network Rail’s independent  auditor in 2015. In addition to providing an opinion on  the group accounts, the C&AG also audits the individual  accounts of Network Rail Infrastructure Finance PLC,  Network Rail Infrastructure Limited and Network Rail (High  Speed) Limited.  Gareth Davies assumed the post of C&AG on 1 June 2019.  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) acted as the independent  auditors for the remaining subsidiaries in 2020/21.  The obligation to appoint the C&AG as Network  Rail’s independent auditor is a direct impact of the  reclassification of Network Rail as an arm’s-length  government body and is in line with standard arrangements  for other public sector bodies.  The company is, therefore, not in a position to comply with  the Competition and Markets Authority’s Order or the UK  Corporate Governance Code 2018 in respect of tendering  prior to the appointment of an auditor and this will remain  the company’s position for the foreseeable future.  Objectivity and independence of the  independent auditor  The NAO is independent of Network Rail in accordance with  the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of financial   114   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard  as applied to listed entities/public interest entities.  The committee has put in place safeguards to maintain  the independent auditor’s objectivity and independence.  To enhance independence and in line with established  auditing standards, a new senior statutory auditor of the  independent auditor is normally appointed every five years,  with other key audit principals within that firm rotated  every seven years.  The committee has established a policy whereby  employment of the independent auditor on other work for  the company is prohibited without prior approval by the  committee, other than for audit services or tax compliance  services. Such requests are unlikely as the NAO does not  offer non-audit services. The NAO does carry out value for  money assessments for Network Rail, but this does not  represent a service to Network Rail as it is performed under  statute and on behalf of Parliament.  In 2020/21 the fee for audit services was £0.597m  (£0.57m in 2019/20). This includes the NAO’s cost of  auditing Network Rail Infrastructure Limited, Network Rail  Infrastructure Finance plc, Network Rail (High Speed) Ltd,  the regulatory accounts and review of interim financial  statements of Network Rail Limited and Network Rail  Infrastructure Finance plc. It excludes the cost of the audit  of some smaller subsidiaries which continue to be audited  by PwC.  The fee paid to PwC for auditing the smaller subsidiaries  was circa £155k in 2020/21 (£150k in 2019/20).  Effectiveness of the external auditor  A review of the independent auditor’s performance  and effectiveness is undertaken as part of the overall  effectiveness review of the auditing process. Following  the conclusion of the 2020/21 reporting cycle, the  auditing process was assessed. The independent auditor  was also invited to comment on what worked well and  where improvements could be made. The committee was  satisfied that the independent auditor was fully effective  and performed as expected in discharging its duties and  obligations. For the second year, the external audit has  been completed in a remote way due to Covid-19 and  yet has remained effective with good communication  between teams.   \\x0cInternal audit  The committee approved the annual internal audit plan  and reviewed throughout the year to check alignment  with the group’s strategic priorities and key risks. At each  meeting the director of risk and internal audit updated  the committee on any changes to the plan, notable  audits, overdue actions, themes, and key issues arising  from internal audit’s work. Despite restrictions presented  by the pandemic, internal audit activities continued  throughout the year and the audit programme was  updated based on the assessment of risk in what was a  changing environment.  In addition to formal risk-based audit, independent reviews  have been undertaken to support key programmes and  the response to emerging issues. These reviews have  included the response to the pandemic, preparations for the  UK’s exit from the EU, and the progress of our intelligent  infrastructure programme.  During the year, a root cause framework has been  introduced to identify common themes arising from audit  activity. These include:  Governance: audits identified cases of less mature  governance, risk and control (GRC) frameworks both   in design and operating effectiveness – for example,   in our audits of post-contract management and   stations management.  Processes and procedures: audits flagged evidence of  gaps that meant the operation of controls could not be  demonstrated – for example, in our audits of our joiners- movers-leavers process where system access was not  periodically reviewed, and leavers were not removed in a  timely manner.  Assurance and monitoring: audits found weaknesses in  assurance and monitoring arrangements – for example,  contract and procurement controls, tunnel evaluations, and  monitoring overcrowding incidents at stations.  Where areas for improvement have been identified through  audit activity, these are being actively managed and  the improvements closely monitored by the committee.  Examples of improvements include: the governance, risk,  assurance and improvement (GRAI) model that is being  embedded to strengthen line of sight between the business  strategy and how this is to be achieved, and the revised  procurement management framework rolled out in 2020.  Corporate governance  The committee approved the internal audit charter which  defines internal audit’s purpose, authority, responsibility  and position within the company.  Risk management and   internal controls  The Board has ultimate responsibility for Network Rail’s risk  management and internal control systems, but delegates  detailed oversight of the function to the committee, which  then reports its findings and makes recommendations to the  Board. This covers all material controls including financial,  operational and compliance controls and risk management  systems. The risk management systems and internal controls  are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk and  can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance  that the group’s risks are being appropriately managed  and mitigated. The delegated responsibilities for risk  management and internal control are detailed in ‘Role and  responsibilities of the committee’ on page 112.  The committee reviews progress against agreed action  plans to manage identified risks. Detailed oversight of  safety related risks is delegated from the Board to the  safety, health and environment compliance committee.  Network Rail’s approach to risk management and  identification, its risk appetite, and an assessment of  principal and emerging risks is provided on pages 77 to 86.  In addition to regular updates, the committee reviews  the emerging and principal risks that require particular  attention. During the year, these were: •  the risk of hostile or malicious acts exploiting  vulnerabilities in Network Rail’s cyber systems  •  the risk of being unable to produce a robust timetable   that is both high quality and high performance  •  the risk of failing to manage the competence of Network   Rail’s employees  •  the risk of failing to deliver and embed the outcomes and   benefits of the Putting Passengers First programme  •  the risk of the railway not meeting normal levels of   performance during adverse and extreme weather events,  today and in the future as a result of climate change •  the opportunity to transform how we operate through   the Putting Passengers First programme to create more  localised decision making   •  there was an exceptional business continuity planning  session in relation to Network Rail’s Covid-19 response.  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   115  \\x0cCorporate governance  Evaluating the effectiveness  of internal control and risk  management systems  The committee regularly reviews the corporate risk profile,  including the status of mitigating actions, and reviews and  approves any changes to the enterprise risk management  (ERM) framework, which determines the design,  implementation, monitoring and review and identification  of risks.   During the year the committee also reviewed and approved  changes to Network Rail’s risk appetite statements and  reviewed the remit of Risk Management to ensure it  remained appropriate for the company’s strategy. The  committee was satisfied that a robust risk process was  in place to manage and mitigate our principal risks with  appropriate plans and monitoring. Where risks have been  identified, appropriate actions are being taken to manage  the impact on passengers, customers and the organisation.  The committee had oversight of the process and  assessment of the group’s prospects to carry on its business  under severe but plausible scenarios undertaken in support  of the viability statement. Further details of the analysis/ scenario testing for the viability statement can be found on  page 87.  Business ethics  The committee reviews and makes recommendations to  the Board on the company’s whistleblowing procedures  and arrangements for the independent investigation and  follow-up of such matters. It also discusses major findings  of internal investigations and management’s response   to them.  In February 2021 the committee assured the Board that  the whistleblowing policy and procedures were adequate  and effective. The committee was updated on action taken  to further enhance the existing framework in the year. This  included: •  distributing posters and wallet cards to promote Network  Rail’s confidential reporting service (known as ‘Speak  Out’)  •  testing staff confidence in the whistleblowing   arrangements in the biennial employee engagement  survey. The results indicate that a large majority of staff  have confidence in the arrangements  116   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  •  an independent review of the whistleblowing policy and   procedures, leading to the policy being updated to reflect  the review’s recommendations. The policy was published  in spring 2020  •  implementing an upgraded Speak Out system, which   included improved wording, question sets and analytics  •  publishing an updated Speak Out policy, which    included new sections on anonymous vs confidential  reporting, how to raise a grievance, and signposting to  additional support  •  including Speak Out as a company-wide process within   the information management system programme.  Network Rail’s confidential reporting service and Speak Out  policy has been in place since 2012. The Speak Out service  is run by an external company on behalf of Network Rail,  and all reports undergo an initial review by our counter  fraud and investigation services team.  In 2020/21, 387 confidential reports were made to the  Speak Out service, which is broadly consistent with the  number of reports made in 2019/20, albeit a slightly  reduced figure which has been attributed to the pandemic.  Each year, on average, 49 per cent of reports made are  substantiated and action taken.  Training modules are in place, designed to enhance our  people’s knowledge and understanding of business ethics,  including information about our whistleblowing policy  and how to report concerns. To date, the training has been  completed by over 41,500 employees.  Planned activities for 2021/22  In the 2021/22 financial year, the committee will continue  its oversight of the risk management and internal control  systems and internal audit, monitoring the integrity of the  financial statements including the interim statements, and  reviewing the external audit process.   The committee will focus on ensuring that the structure  and focus of meetings adapt to the devolved nature of  the organisation and take into account the key challenges  facing the organisation and wider industry. This will  include oversight of the risks specific to each new region;  continued monitoring of the GRAI; assurance of the  capital delivery programme as Project SPEED; is adopted,  embedding of the Putting Passengers First programme,  and; the company’s response to changing passenger  demand following the pandemic.   \\x0cCorporate governance  TREASURY   COMMITTEE REPORT  I took over as chair of the committee on 24 August 2020 and I’m pleased to present the committee’s report into the key  activities undertaken during 2020/21 alongside the work it expects to be doing in 2021/22.

Planned activities for 2021/22  The committee will continue to monitor the progress of the  initiatives underway.  Particular focus will include: •  the potential for future structural changes to the rail  industry and their likely impact on Network Rail’s  financing and treasury activities  •  exploring alternative approaches to raising capital to   fund rail infrastructure and enhancements  •  assessing strategic or corporate finance opportunities   that may be proposed to the Board  •  monitoring cash flow and funding limits.  Corporate governance  Principal activities during the year  During the year, the committee received detailed   updates on Network Rail’s cash and liquidity position,  its debt and derivative portfolio, and its intercompany  financing arrangements.  The committee continued to monitor the impact on  funding caused by the pandemic and the reduction in  Network Rail’s enhancement budget by £1bn following  the Chancellor’s Spending Review. The committee also  reviewed opportunities for third party investment in  Network Rail infrastructure.  The chair provided a summary of the committee’s activities  and its main discussion points and findings to the next  Board meeting and made appropriate recommendations.  Some of the specific topics discussed during 2020/21 were:  Cash and liquidity The committee discussed the continued operation of the  existing loan facility from the Department for Transport  and grant agreements between Network Rail and  governments, as well as the effectiveness of Network Rail’s  banking arrangements.  There was particular focus on the steps taken to mitigate the  impact of Covid-19 on Network Rail’s cash position, including  the early submission of funding requests to reduce potential  operational complications, and the acceleration of grant  receipts to cover an expected fall in income. The committee  also considered the move to support the rail industry supply  chain through Covid-19 by agreeing to more favourable  supplier payment terms, and the subsequent impact on  working capital. Related developments in the wider industry,  including Government support packages for train operators,  were also reviewed closely.  Policy, risk and reform The committee approved a revised policy document  which governs Network Rail’s treasury-related activities.  It reviewed the status of funding and liquidity risk as part  of Network Rail’s enterprise risk process. The committee  discussed various areas of ongoing financial market,  regulatory and rates reform which may have implications  for how Network Rail manages its treasury activities.

It was  difficult for our people; for Network Rail and for the rail  industry as a whole; for the national and local governments  and for the UK economy.  Against this background, I present my report on behalf of  the nomination and remuneration committee.  In 2020/21 Network Rail’s revenue fell dramatically. We  lost income from track access payments and our property  assets. So we had to make some very hard decisions,  including limiting pay awards and payments under the  performance related pay scheme.   In 2021/22 we face difficult decisions again as we begin  to understand what our passenger and freight profile will  look like.   I would like to welcome Fiona Ross as a member of the  committee, and Michael Harrison who becomes a full  member of the committee having been an observer since  May 2017.   The nomination and remuneration committee is a  single committee. However reporting requirements on   remuneration matters means we report on the work of  the committee in two parts. The first section looks at  the ‘nomination’ aspects of the committee’s work, and  the latter section reports the prescribed elements of the  directors’ remuneration report. There is, of course, some  overlap, and this will be highlighted where appropriate.

Others may attend for specific items. Meetings  are routinely attended by a representative from the  Department for Transport.  Role and responsibilities of   the committee  The committee’s role is to consider and comment on: •  Board appointments and the induction of new directors •  Board effectiveness  •  Board and senior executive remuneration •  any other matter within its remit that it may consider   necessary or appropriate.  After each meeting the committee chair briefs the  full Board on the committee’s work, and makes  recommendations as appropriate.  The committee’s terms of reference are on our website:  www.networkrail.co.uk   Principal Nomination activities  during the year  During 2020/21 the committee focussed on: Introducing the Board’s first diversity and inclusion policy Having benchmarked a range of FTSE 100 and transport  industry companies, the committee proposed the adoption  of a Board diversity and inclusion policy.  The Board adopted that policy in February 2021 and it  is available on our website. It supplements our equality,  diversity and inclusion policy and our Everyone Matters  diversity strategy and implements their aspirations in the  context of our senior leaders.   The Board diversity and inclusion policy targets that: •  as a minimum, one third of its directors will be female by   the end of the 2021/22 financial year, and  The search for new non-executive directors The committee oversaw a new in-house approach to  searching for and appointing two new non-executive  directors. The key aim was to reach a different group of  people than might have applied in previous searches.  An open advertising campaign supported a targeted  search that saw direct approaches being made to potential  applicants. Some of the specific backgrounds against  which applicants were researched included technological  innovation, climate change impact, diversity and inclusion,  the digital future, and passenger insight.   Over 350 applicants were screened against the job  description criteria. This resulted in 14 candidates being  interviewed by Network Rail’s HR team.  From that pool, seven candidates were interviewed by  non-executive directors, David Noyes and Fiona Ross. The  four finalist candidates were interviewed by Sir Peter Hendy,  chair of Network Rail, and Ruth Hannant, then Director  General (DfT).  Following the approval of the Secretary of State for  Transport and the Prime Minister, Ismail Amla and  Stephen Duckworth OBE were appointed to the Board on  1 April 2021.  The induction of newly appointed non-executive directors As reported last year, Fiona Ross and Mark Bayley CBE  became directors on 11 May 2020. As this was during  the pandemic lockdown their induction programme was  conducted virtually.  A significant amount of background reading material  was given to Fiona and Mark. They met with all Board  and executive leadership team members, and the group  general counsel and company secretary, as well as some  senior leaders in key areas of the business. Fiona and Mark  also met with representatives from the Department for  Transport. In addition, and as part of his induction to the  audit & risk committee, Mark met with representatives from  the National Audit Office.  Unfortunately, during lockdown we could not do any site  visits. However, these are being planned for later in 2021  and 2022.  •  as a minimum, one of its directors will be from a black,  Asian or minority ethnic background by the end of the  2021/22 financial year.  Michael Harrison was appointed by the Secretary of State  as a director on 11 May 2020. Michael was offered an  induction programme. However, as he had been attending   120   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  Board and some committee meetings since May 2017 it  was agreed that a formal induction programme was not  needed on this occasion.  As part of their induction, we have given Ismail Amla and  Stephen Duckworth reading material and they are meeting  with the other directors, executive leadership team and key  senior executives. They will attend the site visits we arrange  for Fiona and Mark.  Commissioning an independent board   effectiveness evaluation The committee commissioned an independent board  effectiveness evaluation. Three firms were invited to bid for  this work. Following initial discussions with each, two firms  submitted proposals. Those proposals were reviewed in line  with the pre-determined scoring criteria. The proposal from  Manchester Square Partners (MSP) ranked first.  Elaine Sullivan led MSP’s review by meeting Sir Peter  Hendy, chair of Network Rail. Following which, MSP  interviewed all Board directors, the executive leadership  team and colleagues at the DfT, Transport Scotland and  the ORR.   MSP also reviewed Board and committee papers. MSP  attended an Environmental Sustainability committee  meeting and a Board meeting to observe the Board   in action.  MSP discussed its draft report with Sir Peter Hendy before  presenting the report, including recommendations, to the  full Board in July 2021.  The key recommendations from MSP’s review are on  page 102. The committee will monitor progress against  delivering these improvements.  Planned activities for 2021/22  In the year ahead, the committee will continue to:  •  monitor progress against the action plan resulting from the board effectiveness evaluation •  oversee the effective induction of new non-executive directors •  manage any relevant matters relating to rail reform and/or workforce modernisation. •  Review talent development strategies to ensure the organisation has the appropriate skills and capabilities in place to   execute its accountabilities effectively  For information on the remuneration aspects of the committee’s work, please see the directors’ remuneration report starting  on page 123.

The nomination and remuneration  committee, which has been combined since 2018, is dedicated to the highest standards of disclosure on remuneration  and recognises that executive pay is an important issue for a public body. We operate in line with the remuneration  requirements which apply to all UK listed companies and the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The  committee follows good governance practice by reviewing the terms of reference every year.  The 2020 report was approved at the Annual General Meeting by our member, the Secretary of State for Transport (SoS),  along with the current three-year remuneration policy for executive directors (Policy), which is the framework for how  executive directors are paid. This Policy was included in the 2020 directors’ remuneration report and can also be found on  our website www.networkrail.co.uk.  Key agenda items for the year  Our annual remuneration report outlines the outcomes for the 2021 financial year in terms of executive remuneration.   The key points to note for 2020/21 outcomes are: •  In the light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally, as a result of  the Covid-19 pandemic, Network Rail’s chair, Sir Peter Hendy, and chief executive, Andrew Haines, both took a voluntary  reduction in their remuneration of 20% for four months from December 2020 to March 2021.  •  A decision on the 2020/21 performance related pay scheme had not been agreed at time of this report. However, in  light of the financial pressures mentioned above, the chief executive and chief financial officer declined to accept a  performance related payment this year.  The rest of this statement explains how executive remuneration is determined at Network Rail and gives more details on the  outcomes of this year.  Implementation of Policy in 2021  All decisions made by the committee during the year were  in compliance with the Policy. The Policy is based on four  key principles: 1.  Simple: the framework should be transparent and simple   the individual. At the same time, we need to ensure value  for money for the taxpayer and to reflect our status as a  publicly funded body.  3.  Performance and safety: there should be a performance   for all stakeholders to understand.  2.  Competitive and fair: attracting and retaining   leaders of the necessary ability requires remuneration  arrangements that are reasonable in the markets that  we compete in for talent, and which fairly reflect the  appropriate market rates for the skills and experience of   related element of the package which rewards  performance in areas that are most important for our  stakeholders. There shouldn’t be a reward for failure.  The safety of our workforce, passengers and the general  public is at the heart of everything we do and must be  reflected in the remuneration framework.  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   123  \\x0cCorporate governance  4.  Aligned across Network Rail: where possible, remuneration structures will be aligned across the organisation. All   Network Rail employees continue to be eligible for performance related pay, determined using a consistent performance  framework across the organisation, although it is not a contractual entitlement.  The remuneration framework for executive directors agreed in 2020 is based on these principles and includes the   following elements:  Salary  Pension  Salaries are set at a level which reflects the skills and experience of the individual as well as  the scope of the responsibilities of the role.  Participation in pension schemes is on the same basis as other managerial positions at  Network Rail.  Performance related pay  Our plan is based on the achievement of stretching annual performance targets, which is  aligned to the business scorecard.  2020/21 outcomes for   executive directors   Business performance is measured through the scorecards.  These evaluate performance against key measures  and targets that have been agreed with customers and  stakeholders. Since 2019/20, the reference for performance  related pay (PRP) was changed to a dashboard with  simpler, more outcome-focussed set of measures, that  Network Rail’s stakeholders, especially passengers, would  see as a success. The measures on the dashboard and the  business scorecards are aligned. PRP for senior employees  uses the national dashboard outturn and one quarter  (25 per cent) of PRP is also determined by an individual’s  performance rating. This gives a direct line of sight between  the achievement of individual objectives and PRP.  Overall National scorecard performance was below target  at 40.4 per cent. The PRP dashboard outturn was slightly  lower at 37.6 per cent.  At the time of publication, as we continue to assess the  financial and economic consequences of the Covid-19  pandemic, a decision on the PRP outcome for 2020/21 has  not been made. However, the chief executive and the chief  financial officer have both declined a PRP payment for the year.  Further details of the PRP scheme can be found on page 126.  124   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  National dashboard  There is a distinct set of performance measures set  specifically for performance related pay, and whilst these  are different from the measures on business scorecards,  they have been chosen to closely mirror overall business  performance. The measures on the dashboard represent  the key strategic themes of train service delivery, safety,  efficiencies and people.  David Noyes, chair, nomination and remuneration committee 15 July 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  ANNUAL  REMUNERATION REPORT  This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule  8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report)  (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Where indicated, some of the disclosures in these  sections have been audited.  Single total figure of remuneration for 2020/21 (audited)  The table below summarises all remuneration for the executive directors in respect of 2020/21 (and the prior year  comparative). Further discussion of each of the components is set out on the pages which follow.  £’000  Salary  Benefits1  Pension2  Performance  Related Pay (PRP)   Total  2020/21 2019/20 2020/21 2019/20 2020/21 2019/20 2020/21 2019/20 2020/21 2019/20  Jeremy  Westlake  Andrew  Haines OBE  3733  371  5544  593  12  3  12  3  33  0  34  0  05  05  0  0  417  417  557  595  1. Benefits include car allowance, private medical cover, any annual travel subsidy, life assurance and relocation.  2. Pension includes the value of all pension benefits receivable in respect of the relevant year. This includes any supplementary cash allowance and a value  from participation in the defined benefit or defined contribution pension arrangements or allowances for those who have opted out of their respective  pension arrangements in the relevant year (calculated in accordance with the methodology prescribed by the Regulations). Further details of these  pension benefits are set out in the pension section on page 127.  3. Jeremy Westlake’s salary is slightly higher in 2020/21 as there was an additional working day in the financial year.  4. In light of the financial pressures facing Network Rail, the whole railway, and the public sector generally as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, Andrew   Haines’ took a voluntary reduction in remuneration of 20% for four periods from December 2020 to March 2021.  5.  In the light of the financial pressures arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, the executive directors declined to receive a payment under the PRP 2020/21 scheme. Pay Ratios (audited)  The Government announced new legislation for employers  to publish their pay ratios from 2020. The pay ratio is  the gap between the chief executive and the 25th, 50th  and 75th percentile of employees - using the single figure  disclosed in remuneration reporting in the table above. A  historical record will be published incrementally to a 10- year period moving forward.  For transparency and good governance, the nomination  and remuneration committee decided to publish the pay  ratio information a year early in the 2018/19 report and to   also publish the information from 2017/18 so that it could  be compared.   There are three calculation methodologies to choose from: A. Calculate total remuneration for all employees and take  the percentiles to calculate the pay ratio against the  chief executive single figure total remuneration.  B.  Using existing pay data i.e. gender pay gap reporting, take  the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles and then calculate  the total remuneration for these and compare against the  chief executive single figure total remuneration.   Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   125  \\x0cCorporate governance  C.  Same as option B but using other recent pay data.  The nomination and remuneration committee decided that option B, using existing gender pay gap reporting, would be  used. This data already exists and is in the public domain, therefore more familiar and easier to obtain.  Method  25th percentile pay ratio  Median pay ratio  75th percentile pay ratio  2017/18  2018/192  2019/203  2020/21  Option B  Option B  Option B  Option B  25.1:1  20.9:1  18.0:1  17.5:1  20.0:1  16.1:1  14.3:1  14.3:1  16.2:1  13.3:1  11:9:1  12.8:1  1. PRP has been removed from the calculations for all years for consistency, as a decision on PRP for employees for 2020/21 was not made at the time of   this report.  2. Change of chief executive during the year. Pay ratio based on Mark Carne CBE and Andrew Haines OBE’s combined single figure total for 2018/19  3. Andrew Haines OBE’s single figure total was used for 2019/20.  When taking the employee data for the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile, the total remuneration figure has been calculated  based on an office worker at these percentiles rather than other employee groups. Using a front-line or operations worker  would have reduced the ratio as these types of roles can be eligible for overtime, allowances and shift payments, all of  which would have increased the comparator pay and decreased the ratio. The additional payments are not guaranteed and  therefore likely to change each year. The total remuneration figure for an office worker at these percentiles is likely to be  lower and also less variable year on year. It is therefore considered to be a better comparator.  Whilst the pay ratio for the 25th percentile has decreased since last year, this has not been the case for the median and  75th percentile. The employees selected in these percentiles were in management roles who were not given a pay award  during 2020/21, which has impacted the pay ratios in comparison to the previous year.   Executive director changes  There have been no changes this year.  Incentive plan 2020/21 – annual performance related pay (audited)   During the year, two directors were eligible to participate  in this scheme; Jeremy Westlake and Andrew Haines OBE.  The maximum potential annual performance related  pay award for Jeremy Westlake in 2020/21 was 20 per  cent of salary. Andrew Haines OBE’s maximum potential  annual performance related pay award was nine per  cent. Stretching performance targets were set at the start  of the year in the context of the PRP dashboard. The  approach for performance related pay is aligned across the  business, including executive directors. The PRP dashboard  outturn, which is closely related to the business scorecard,  determines the percentage pay-out against the maximum  award. For 2020/21, one quarter (25 per cent) of PRP  was based on an individual’s performance rating, and   each rating carried a different percentage weighting. For  example, a ‘good’ performance rating will have an 11.25  per cent contribution to the overall PRP.  Performance against the national scorecard is summarised  on pages 26 to 29. Our National scorecard performance  was below target at 40.4 per cent. We benefited from the  reduced timetable – we had fewer passengers and ran  fewer trains. This resulted in better than planned train  performance, and it also allowed us to finish ahead of  our budgeted renewals work. Overall performance was  impacted by the workforce fatalities we have had this year,  coupled with the impact of the Stonehaven derailment.  Due to Covid-19, no network wide passenger satisfaction   126   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  surveys were undertaken in the year and as a result the  passenger satisfaction measure was set at zero per cent. The Performance-Related Pay (PRP) dashboard outturn is  slightly lower than our National scorecard at 37.6 per cent.  This is partly due to our performance against two index  measures not captured in the PRP dashboard; to measure  our environmental sustainability and how we handle  complaints, offset by the weighting we have given to the  financial performance in the PRP dashboard. In addition,  each year the safety, health and environment committee   (SHEC) considers the overall outturn from a safety  perspective and decides whether to recommend any further  adjustments to reflect safety performance.  Having reviewed the outturns of the safety measures and  the overall safety performance, the committee concluded  that no further adjustments were required besides setting  the Passenger Safety measure to zero (agreed earlier in the  year to recognise the impact of the Stonehaven derailment  and associated fatalities).  Pension (audited)   1.  Executive directors are eligible to participate in one of the Network Rail defined benefit pension schemes or the defined   contribution pension scheme on the same basis as other employees.  2.  Under the existing executive pension policy, Jeremy Westlake is entitled to an allowance in lieu of pension on the same   basis as other employees of Network Rail, subject to the discretion of the group HR director. This allowance is equivalent  to the employer’s pension contributions otherwise payable, minus an adjustment for the cost of providing continued  life assurance and the employer National Insurance Contributions payable. Andrew Haines OBE was not eligible to an  allowance in lieu of pension as part of his appointment.  3.  Previously, executive directors received an additional pension allowance in the form of a cash supplement based on a   percentage of their earnings above the notional earnings cap (£170,400 for 2021/21 tax year and previously £166,200  for 2019/20). This policy no longer applies to new appointments.  The table below sets out details for executive directors for 2021 in respect of all Network Rail pension benefits, split between  the defined benefit and defined contribution/additional allowance. The value shown in the final column of this table is  included as the pension column in the single total figure of remuneration on page 125.

Transfer values as at 31 March 2021 have been calculated in accordance with the ‘Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Values) (Amendment)   Regulations 2008’.  4. For the defined benefit schemes, the value shown in the single figure table (A) has been calculated in accordance with the regulations by applying a  multiplier of 20 to the increase in accrued pension (net of inflation) during the year. For the additional pension allowance (B), the value shown is the  gross cash allowance in the year. The value shown in the single figure table is the sum of A and B.

The fees for  the non-executive directors were last reviewed in 2016 for new appointments and were decreased at the time.  The table below summarises the remuneration for the non-executive directors for 2020/21.  1. Rob Brighouse’s fees were higher for 2020/21 as he   became the Senior Independent Director.  2.

Network  Rail is a not-for-dividend company so cannot provide data on returns to shareholders. Therefore, other key Network Rail metrics  have been used in the table below to show employee remuneration in the context of overall business activities.  Total employee remuneration  Total expenditure  2020/21  £2,802m  £10,829m  2020/19  £2,715m  £9,392m  Change (%)  3.2  15.3  130   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cCorporate governance  Consideration of directors’ remuneration – remuneration committee and advisers  The committee during the year was made up of the following  independent non-executive directors: David Noyes, Sir Peter  Hendy CBE, Fiona Ross and Michael Harrison.  The group general counsel and company secretary  is secretary to the committee. The committee is also  supported by the group HR director, and senior reward  manager. The chief executive attends meetings when  invited by the committee. No individual is present when  their own remuneration is being discussed.  In line with best practice, the committee seeks independent  external advice when needed. During the year, the  committee retained Deloitte LLP to provide independent   advice on executive remuneration. Deloitte was chosen  by the committee in 2012 following a selection process  undertaken by the committee. The committee is satisfied  that the Deloitte engagement partner and team provide fair  and independent remuneration advice to the committee  and do not have any connections with Network Rail  that may affect this. Deloitte is a founding member of  the Remuneration Consultants Group and voluntarily  operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive  remuneration consulting in the UK. The code of conduct  can be found at www.remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.  Deloitte did not provide any advice to the committee during  2020/21, and as such no fees were payable in this respect.

The committee continues  to cover policy, governance and decision-making in relation to all senior employees with salaries above the pay threshold.  The full terms of reference of the committee can be found on the website: www.networkrail.co.uk.  Pay for performance structure for executive directors – aligned to what is  important for customers   The PRP arrangements for executive directors and other employees are aligned to business performance and based on the  national dashboard outturn.  Since 2019/20, Network Rail moved from route/region/function scorecards to a dashboard with a set of output-focussed  measures which better reward delivery. Reducing the number of measures from previous years enables sufficient weightings  to each measure so that it is significant enough to reward success. The national dashboard has been designed to ensure our  customers and, through them, our passengers are at the heart of how we operate.  Train service delivery 45%  Efficiencies 30%  People 5%  Safety 20%  National Dashboard for 2020/21  The dashboards align to four strategic themes. There are nine measures, carefully weighted to incentivise and reward  success, whilst giving an appropriate weighting to important areas such as train service delivery and safety (which is  measured through Train Accident Risk Reduction for passengers and Fatalities and Weighted Injuries for Workforce Safety).  The dashboard is shown in the table on the next page.  132   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cStrategic Themes  Measure  On Time The percentage of Recorded Station Stops called at on time (early or  <1min late)  Passenger Satisfaction The percentage of passengers surveyed who were satisfied with their  overall journey.   Freight Delivery Metric (FDM) The percentage of commercial freight trains that arrive at planned  destination within 15 minutes of scheduled time. Freight trains are only  considered to have failed FDM where a delay is caused by Network Rail.  Composite Reliability Index (CRI) A measure of the short-term condition and performance of our assets  including track, signalling, points, electrification, telecoms, buildings,  structures and earthworks. The index shows the total percentage  improvement in asset reliability compared to the end of the previous  Control Period.  Financial Performance Measure (FPM) An assessment of how Network Rail have performed compared to the  financial targets set out in the CP6 Business Plan. The measure is an  aggregation of the three individual FPM measures from prior years  (P&L, Renewals and Enhancements).  Enhancement Milestones The number of milestones completed ahead of time or on time, as a  percentage of all milestones planned for delivery in the year.  Employee Engagement An index representing the proportion of employees surveyed who  responded favourably to key questions on engagement.  Workforce Fatalities and Weighted Injuries (FWI) An index representing workforce safety, using fatalities and non-fatal  injuries per hour worked. A lower FWI represents better performance.  Passenger Safety (TARR) Measures achievement of the key milestones and metrics to reduce  train accident risk. TARR is made up of milestone targets and volume  targets, both of which have different achievement weightings.  Train service delivery   Efficiencies  People  Safety  Corporate governance  Weighting  Target  12.5%  65.1%  20.0%  83.5%  7.5%  94.0%  5.0%  1.1%  20.0%  £0m  10.0%  90.0%  5.0%  61.0%  10.0%  0.059  10.0%  90.0%  Regional dashboards include measures which match each regions’ responsibilities along with universal measures such as  safety and financial performance. Local scorecards are still used to manage business performance at a local level, but they  are not linked to PRP.  In addition, no payment will be made in respect of any performance measure which fails to exceed the minimum level of  performance (worse than target threshold) and evidence of under reporting against safety would result in the outcome of  the safety measures being reviewed and reducing performance accordingly, including potentially to zero.  One quarter (25 per cent) of PRP will be determined by an individual’s performance rating. This provides a direct line of  sight between the achievement of individual objectives and PRP. For executive directors and employees aligned to the  national dashboard, the figure below demonstrates how individual performance-related pay is calculated:  National dashboard   (100%)  3/4  Dashboard  out-turn  +  1/4  Individual  performance  =  Individual  performance-  related pay  Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   133  \\x0cCorporate governance  DIRECTORS’ REPORT  The directors present their annual report and the audited  accounts for the year ending 31 March 2021.  party and in which a director of the company is or was  materially interested (as defined by Listing Rule LR 9.8.4R).  Disclosures on business performance and activities,  future business developments and risk management are  contained in the strategic report (pages 10 to 88) and  corporate governance report (pages 89 to 136).  The company is limited by guarantee, having no share  capital, so there are no share disclosures in this report.  Political donations  It is Network Rail’s policy not to make political donations  or to incur political expenditure in the UK and the EU. No  political donations were made, and no political expenditure  was incurred during the year (2019/20: £nil).  Directors  The directors who served during the year and held office  at the date of signing the annual report and accounts are  detailed on pages 90 to 93.  Directors’ conflicts of interest  In accordance with company law and the company’s  articles of association, the directors have the power to  authorise any matter which would or might otherwise  constitute or give rise to a direct or indirect conflict of  interest. However, the authority can only be exercised if  a director has declared their actual or potential conflict  of interest to the Board. The directors have a continuing  obligation to update any changes to their conflicts of  interest. Further details about directors’ conflicts of interest  can be found on page 103.  Branches  The company’s subsidiary, Network Rail Consulting Limited,  has established branches in Dubai and Saudi Arabia; and  subsidiaries in Australia, Canada and the United States of  America (USA).

Engagement with our people,  passengers and stakeholders  Further information on our engagement with our people,  passengers and stakeholders can be found in How we  engage with our Stakeholders on pages 24 and 25. This sets  out the actions that Network Rail has taken this year to: •  build the views of our people into decision-making   processes and encourage their active involvement in the  company’s performance  •  understand what’s important to railway users and provide   the service they expect  •  work with industry partners to operate a world-class railway •  make a positive contribution to local communities and   the environment  •  support U.K. governments and our supply chain partners   to promote economic growth and develop a railway fit for  the future.  134   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  \\x0cFinancial disclosures  Disclosures relating to the group’s use of financial instruments,  financial risk management objectives and policies of the  company, including its policy for hedging each major type of  forecasted transaction for which hedge accounting is used; its  exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk  can be found under Note 25, pages 183 to 188.  Particulars of important events affecting the group since  the financial year end and an indication of likely future  developments can be found in the chief financial officer’s  (CFO) statement, pages 30 to 34.  Directors’ statement of  responsibilities  The directors are responsible for preparing the annual  report, the directors’ remuneration report, and the  financial statements in accordance with applicable law  and regulations.  Company law requires the directors to prepare financial  statements for each financial year. Under that law the  directors have prepared the group and company financial  statements in accordance with International Financial  Reporting Standards (IFRSs). Under company law the  directors must not approve the financial statements unless  they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the  state of affairs of the group and the company, and of the  profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these  financial statements, the directors are required to: •  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them   consistently  •  make judgements and accounting estimates that are   reasonable and prudent  •  state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed,  subject to any material departures disclosed and  explained in the financial statements.  The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting  records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s  transactions and disclose, with reasonable accuracy, at any  time the financial position of the company and the group. This  enables them to ensure that the financial statements and the  directors’ remuneration report comply with the Companies  Act 2006 and, as regards the group financial statements,  Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for  safeguarding the assets of the company and the group, and   Corporate governance  hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and  detection of fraud and other irregularities.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and  distribution of financial statements may differ from  legislation in other jurisdictions.  The directors are responsible for the maintenance and  integrity of the company’s website.  The directors consider that the annual report and accounts,  taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and  provides the information necessary for its member to assess  the company’s performance, business model and strategy.  Each of the directors in office at the date of this report,  whose names and functions are listed on pages 90 to 93  confirm that to the best of their knowledge: •  the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the  applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and  fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and  profit of the group and the undertakings included in the  consolidation taken as a whole  •  the management report is incorporated into the   strategic report and directors’ report for the purposes  of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.8R).  It includes a fair review of the development and  performance of the business and the position of the  group and the undertakings included in the consolidation  taken as a whole, together with a description of the  principal risks and uncertainties that the group faces.  Independent auditor  Resolutions for the re-appointment of the current independent  auditor, the National Audit Office, who also acts for the  Comptroller and Auditor General, and to authorise the audit  and risk committee (ARC) to determine the independent  auditor’s remuneration, will be proposed at the forthcoming  annual general meeting. The notice of meeting is enclosed,  together with explanatory notes, in a pack with this report.  Disclosure of information to the  independent auditor   Each of the directors at the date of approval of this report  confirms that:  •  so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit   Annual Report and Accounts 2021   \\\\   Network Rail Limited   \\\\   135  \\x0cCorporate governance  information of which the company’s independent auditor  is unaware  •  the director has taken all the steps that they ought to  have taken as a director in order to make them aware  of any relevant audit information and to establish that  the company’s independent auditor is aware of that  information.  Going concern statement  The group’s business activities, together with the factors  likely to affect its future development, performance and  position and the group’s principal risks and uncertainties  are set out in the strategic report section, pages 10 to 88.  The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity  position and borrowing facilities are described in the CFO’s  review, pages 30 to 34. Note 25 to the accounts on page  183 includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes  for managing its capital; its financial risk management  objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging  activities; and its exposures to credit, liquidity and foreign  exchange risk. The viability statement on page 87 sets out a  longer-term assessment than this going concern statement.  The group has considerable financial resources together  with long-term contracts with a number of customers   and suppliers.  Business plans and financial models are used to project  cash flows and monitor financial risks and liquidity  positions, forecast funding requirements and other key  financial ratios, including those relevant to our network  licence. Analysis is undertaken to understand the resilience  of the group and its business model to the potential impact  of the group’s principal risks, or a combination of those  risks. This analysis takes account of the mitigating actions  realistically to be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or  occurrence of the underlying risks. In considering the likely  effectiveness of such actions, the conclusions of the Board’s  regular monitoring and review of risk management and  internal control systems, as described on pages 77 to 86,  are disclosed in detail.  Consequently, the directors believe that the group is well  placed to manage its business risks.  After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable  expectation that the company and the group have  adequate resources to continue in operational existence for  the foreseeable future.  136   /   Network Rail Limited   /   Annual Report and Accounts 2021  For this reason and on the basis of the above, the directors  consider it appropriate for the group to adopt the going  concern basis in preparing its annual report and accounts.  Post Balance sheet events  Network Rail’s response to the coronavirus pandemic has  been discussed throughout the report, including the chief  executive’s report on page 12 and the risk management  report on pages 77 to 88. Regional responses to the crisis  have also been highlighted on pages 36 to 55.  The Williams-Shapps Plan for Rail and its plans to reform  the rail industry were published after the balance sheet  date. This proposes that, commencing in late 2023, a  new public body, Great British Railways, will integrate the  railways, owning the infrastructure, collecting fare revenue,  running, and planning the network, and setting most fares  and timetables. It is planned that Network Rail will be  absorbed into the public body to bring about single, unified,  and accountable leadership for the national network. At this  stage it is not likely that this reform will involve the winding  up of Network Rail Limited but in any event Great British  Railways will assume the existing functions of Network  Rail Limited as well as have a wider range of powers and  functions. The transformation programme is dependent on  further activities including legislation and will take time to  fully deliver.   The change in corporation tax rates, to 25% from 19%  (effective from April 2023), was substantively enacted in  the Finance Bill 2021 after the balance sheet date. It is  estimated that this will increase the deferred tax provision  by £1.0bn and will be reflected in next year’s accounts.  Aside from the above, as at the date of signing these  financial statements there have not been any significant  post balance sheet events, whether adjusting or non- adjusting.
